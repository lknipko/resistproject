## Quick Actions

### Email Your Representatives

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Protect Reproductive Healthcare - Oppose Federal Abortion Restrictions"
  repType="all"
  body={`Dear {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to urge you to defend reproductive healthcare and oppose the administration's systematic attacks on abortion access.

Since January 2025, the administration has:
- Reinstated the Hyde Amendment restrictions across all federal programs
- Cut funding to Title X family planning services
- Rescinded abortion travel coverage for military service members
- Threatened to enforce the 1873 Comstock Act to ban abortion nationwide

These actions disproportionately harm low-income women, women of color, military families, and anyone living in a state with abortion bans.

I urge you to:
1. Co-sponsor legislation to repeal the Hyde Amendment
2. Co-sponsor legislation to repeal the Comstock Act
3. Vote to restore Title X funding and military abortion travel coverage
4. Oppose any further restrictions on reproductive healthcare

Reproductive healthcare is a fundamental right. I expect you to stand up for your constituents' access to comprehensive healthcare, including abortion.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}
/>

### Call Your Representatives

<CallRepButton
  repType="all"
  script={`Hi, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm calling from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge {repName} to support repealing the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for abortion and disproportionately harms low-income women, women of color, and military service members.

I also urge {repName} to co-sponsor legislation to repeal the Comstock Act and to oppose any enforcement of this 1873 law that could ban abortion nationwide.

Every person deserves access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare, regardless of their income or insurance coverage.

Thank you for your time.`}

### Protect Medication Abortion

**Why this matters:** Medication abortion (mifepristone + misoprostol) accounts for 60% of all U.S. abortions. The FDA has delayed a safety review until after the 2026 midterms, but access remains under threat from lawsuits and potential Comstock Act enforcement.

**Actions:**

1. **Contact the FDA:**
   - Email: [FDA Contact Form](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/contact-fda)
   - Urge them to maintain current telehealth and mail-order access
   - Oppose any restrictions not based on scientific evidence

2. **Support State Shield Laws:**
   - Advocate for state legislation protecting providers who mail abortion pills across state lines
   - Contact your state legislators to support "shield law" bills

3. **Know Your Rights:**
   - Medication abortion remains legal via telehealth in many states
   - Resources: [Plan C Pills](https://www.plancpills.org/) (information on accessing abortion pills)
   - [Aid Access](https://aidaccess.org/) (international telemedicine service)

4. **Oppose Comstock Act Enforcement:**
   - Call your representatives to oppose DOJ enforcement of Comstock
   - Support federal legislation to repeal the Comstock Act entirely

5. **Vote in 2026 Midterms:**
   - The FDA delayed its mifepristone review until after the November 2026 midterms
   - Congressional control will determine whether abortion restrictions can be blocked
   - **Register to vote:** [Vote.gov](https://vote.gov)
   - Check your registration and request absentee ballot if needed
