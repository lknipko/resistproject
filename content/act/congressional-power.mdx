# Demand Congress Enforce Its Authority

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Demand that Congress enforce the Impoundment Control Act, defend its constitutional power of the purse, and hold the executive branch accountable for illegally withholding funds that Congress appropriated. This is a bipartisan issue -- regardless of political party, every member of Congress has a duty to protect the legislative branch's authority over federal spending.

## Quick Actions

### Email Your Representatives

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Enforce the Impoundment Control Act -- Defend Congressional Authority"
  repType="all"
  body={`Dear {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to urge you to take immediate action to enforce the Impoundment Control Act and defend Congress's constitutional authority over federal spending.

The administration has illegally withheld billions in congressionally appropriated funds. The Government Accountability Office has confirmed that multiple funding pauses constitute violations of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Federal courts have issued injunctions ordering the release of frozen funds. Yet Congress has not taken meaningful action to enforce its own authority.

This is not a partisan issue. The Impoundment Control Act was passed with a vote of 401-6 in the House after President Nixon demonstrated why no president -- of either party -- should have unilateral power to override Congress's spending decisions. Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution gives Congress, not the President, the power of the purse.

I urge you to:

1. Support oversight hearings on Impoundment Control Act violations
2. Co-sponsor legislation to strengthen the ICA with automatic enforcement mechanisms
3. Publicly demand the release of all illegally withheld funds
4. Support the GAO Comptroller General's authority to bring enforcement actions

If Congress does not defend its own authority now, every future president will claim the power to nullify any law by simply refusing to fund it. This precedent threatens the constitutional system regardless of which party holds the White House.

Thank you for your attention to this critical constitutional issue.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}
/>

### Call Your Representatives

<CallRepButton
  repType="all"
  script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge {repName} to enforce the Impoundment Control Act. The administration has illegally withheld billions in congressionally appropriated funds, and the GAO has confirmed these are violations of federal law.

Congress has the constitutional power of the purse, and it must defend that authority regardless of party. I urge {repName} to support oversight hearings, demand the release of frozen funds, and co-sponsor legislation to strengthen the Impoundment Control Act.

This is about protecting Congress's authority, not partisan politics. Thank you.`}

### Target the Appropriations Committees

The Appropriations Committees write the spending bills. Their members have the most direct interest in defending Congress's power of the purse. These are the most important offices to contact on impoundment.

**Senate Appropriations Committee:**
- [Full Committee Members](https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/about/members)
- Committee Phone: 202-224-7363

**House Appropriations Committee:**
- [Full Committee Members](https://appropriations.house.gov/about/members)
- Committee Phone: 202-225-2771

**Senate Budget Committee:**
- Also relevant because impoundment is a budget process issue
- [Committee Members](https://www.budget.senate.gov/about/membership)
- Committee Phone: 202-224-0642

**House Budget Committee:**
- [Committee Members](https://budget.house.gov/about/membership)
- Committee Phone: 202-226-7270

## Why This Is Bipartisan

This is a critical framing point. When you contact your representatives, emphasize that this is about **congressional authority**, not about any specific program or policy.

**For Republican representatives:**

> "The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse. Conservative principles require limited executive power and respect for the separation of powers. If this President can refuse to spend what Congress appropriated, a future Democratic President could refuse to fund defense, border security, or law enforcement. Defending the Impoundment Control Act protects conservative priorities under future administrations."

**For Democratic representatives:**

> "The programs being defunded are critical to millions of Americans, but this issue is bigger than any single program. If Congress does not enforce the Impoundment Control Act now, it permanently surrenders its most important check on executive power. Future presidents of either party will claim this precedent. Congress must act to protect its institutional authority."

**Key bipartisan arguments:**

1. **Institutional self-interest**: Every member of Congress benefits from congressional spending authority. Allowing the President to override appropriations diminishes every legislator's power.

2. **Precedent**: The precedent applies to future administrations of both parties. A Republican Congress would not want a Democratic President refusing to fund the military; a Democratic Congress would not want a Republican President refusing to fund healthcare.

3. **Constitutional oath**: Every member of Congress swore to "support and defend the Constitution." Article I grants Congress the power of the purse. Failing to enforce this power violates that oath.

4. **Historical precedent**: The ICA passed 401-6 in the House. Both parties overwhelmingly agreed in 1974 that presidential impoundment was unconstitutional. Nothing has changed.

### Attend Town Halls

Town halls are the most effective way to put your representative on the spot about impoundment. Here is how to make an impact:

**Find Town Halls:**
- [Town Hall Project](https://townhallproject.com/) - Comprehensive database of upcoming town halls and public events
- Check your representative's official website for scheduled events
- Follow your representative on social media for event announcements
- Call the district office and ask when the next town hall is scheduled

**Ask About Impoundment:**

Prepare a specific question. Vague questions are easy to dodge. Example:

> "[Representative/Senator NAME], the GAO has confirmed that the administration violated the Impoundment Control Act by withholding funds that Congress appropriated. As a member of Congress, what specific steps are you taking to enforce your own institution's constitutional authority over spending? Will you support hearings and legislation to strengthen the ICA?"

**Tips for Town Halls:**
- Arrive early for a good seat and a chance to ask your question
- Bring a printed copy of your question in case you get nervous
- Be respectful but persistent -- don't accept vague answers
- Record the response (check local recording laws first)
- Share the exchange on social media to amplify the message
- Coordinate with other attendees so multiple people ask about the same issue
- Bring fact sheets to hand to other attendees (see Resources below)

---

### Demand Oversight Hearings

The most effective legislative response to impoundment is oversight hearings. Here is what to demand:

**What Hearings Should Cover:**

1. **GAO testimony** on documented Impoundment Control Act violations
2. **OMB Director testimony** under oath about the scope and rationale for funding freezes
3. **State officials' testimony** about the impact of frozen federal funds on state programs
4. **Legal experts' testimony** on the constitutionality of the administration's impoundment claims
5. **Agency inspector general testimony** on whether agencies are disbursing appropriated funds

**How to Demand Hearings:**

- Call your representative and specifically request that they **ask committee chairs** to schedule impoundment oversight hearings
- Contact Appropriations Committee members directly (see above)
- Contact the Government Accountability and Reform committees in both chambers
- Write letters to the editor mentioning the lack of oversight hearings
- Organize constituent delegations to visit district offices and request hearings

**Relevant Congressional Committees:**

| Committee | Role | Contact |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Senate Appropriations | Controls spending bills | 202-224-7363 |
| House Appropriations | Controls spending bills | 202-225-2771 |
| Senate Budget | Budget process oversight | 202-224-0642 |
| House Budget | Budget process oversight | 202-226-7270 |
| Senate Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs | Government operations oversight | 202-224-4751 |
| House Oversight & Accountability | Executive branch oversight | 202-225-5074 |

### Write Op-Eds and Letters to the Editor

Local newspapers influence congressional offices. Representatives track local media coverage closely.

**Letter to the Editor Template (under 200 words):**

```
Dear Editor,

When Congress passes a spending bill, the President is constitutionally
required to spend those funds as directed. Yet the current administration
has illegally withheld billions in congressionally appropriated money,
and the Government Accountability Office has confirmed these are
violations of the Impoundment Control Act.

This is not a partisan issue. The ICA was passed 401-6 in the House
in 1974 after Nixon tried the same thing. If any President can simply
refuse to execute the budget, Congress becomes irrelevant.

[Senator/Representative NAME] has a duty to defend Congress's
constitutional power of the purse. I urge them to support oversight
hearings and legislation to enforce the Impoundment Control Act.

[Your Name]
[Your City]
```

**Op-Ed Tips:**
- Keep under 600 words
- Lead with your local connection and personal stake
- Reference specific programs in your community affected by the funding freeze
- Name your representative and make a specific ask
- Submit to multiple local papers

---

### Track Impoundment in Your State

Federal funding freezes affect every state differently. Understanding the local impact makes your advocacy more effective.

**How to Find Your State's Exposure:**

1. **USAspending.gov** - [Track federal spending by state](https://www.usaspending.gov/). Search your state to see which federal grants flow to your community.

2. **State budget office** - Most states publish reports on federal revenue. Search "[Your State] federal funds budget" to find how dependent your state is on federal money.

3. **Your state's comptroller or auditor** - May have published analysis of the impact of federal funding disruptions.

4. **Local news** - Search for stories about specific programs affected in your area (Head Start closures, Medicaid disruptions, infrastructure delays).

**Key Data Points to Find:**
- What percentage of your state's budget comes from federal funds?
- Which specific programs in your community were disrupted by the funding freeze?
- Has your state attorney general joined litigation challenging the impoundment?
- Are any local organizations (nonprofits, hospitals, schools) reporting federal funding disruptions?

### Talking Points

**For calls and meetings, remember these key facts:**

1. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 makes it illegal for the President to withhold congressionally appropriated funds without notifying Congress
2. The GAO has confirmed the administration violated the ICA multiple times
3. Federal courts have issued injunctions ordering the release of frozen funds
4. The ICA passed 401-6 in the House -- this was a bipartisan law
5. If this precedent stands, any future President can nullify any law by refusing to fund it
6. Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution gives Congress -- not the President -- the power of the purse
7. States that rely most on federal funds are disproportionately affected, including rural, Republican-leaning states
