## Issue-Specific Scripts

### DOGE & Federal Workforce

> "I'm calling to urge [NAME] to demand oversight of the Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE has fired over 260,000 federal employees, accessed Treasury payment systems controlling $6.8 trillion in annual payments, and dismantled agencies including CFPB and USAID -- while Elon Musk holds $15 billion in government contracts. This is an unprecedented conflict of interest. I urge [NAME] to support congressional hearings and demand that GAO audit all DOGE actions. [Learn more](/learn/doge)"

### ICE Detention & Deportation

> "I'm calling about the immigration enforcement crisis. The detention population has doubled since January 2025. Military bases are being converted to detention camps. ICE revoked the sensitive locations policy protecting schools, churches, and hospitals. U.S. citizens and legal residents have been wrongfully detained and deported, including Kilmar Abrego Garcia who was sent to El Salvador despite a court order. I urge [NAME] to demand oversight hearings and reinstate due process protections. [Learn more](/learn/ice-detention-deportation)"

### January 6th Pardons & DOJ

> "I'm calling about the mass pardon of approximately 1,500 January 6th defendants, including people convicted of seditious conspiracy and assaulting 140 police officers. Career DOJ prosecutors are being purged, and the department is being used to investigate the prosecutors who investigated Trump. I urge [NAME] to defend DOJ independence and hold oversight hearings on the politicization of federal law enforcement. [Learn more](/learn/pardons-justice-system)"

### Epstein Files & Accountability

> "I'm calling to urge [NAME] to support a comprehensive investigation into the Epstein sex trafficking case. Over 100 identified victims were children. Only Ghislaine Maxwell has been charged. The FBI investigative file has not been released. The 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement granted blanket immunity to unnamed co-conspirators. The Senate Judiciary Committee has subpoena power to access sealed materials. I urge the Senator to use it. [Learn more](/learn/epstein-files)"

### Tariffs & Trade War

> "I'm calling about the tariff policies. The 145% tariffs on China and 25% on Canada and Mexico are projected to cost American families $2,100 to $3,800 per year. The Court of International Trade ruled key tariffs exceed presidential authority under IEEPA. I urge [NAME] to support the Congressional Trade Authority Act restoring Congress's constitutional trade power. [Learn more](/learn/tariffs)"

### Press Freedom

> "I'm calling about attacks on press freedom. Journalists have been arrested covering protests, news outlets banned from White House briefings, the DOJ has issued subpoenas for reporter sources, and the FCC is threatening broadcast licenses of outlets with critical coverage. I urge [NAME] to defend the First Amendment and support the PRESS Act protecting journalists from government surveillance. [Learn more](/learn/press-freedom)"

### USAID & Foreign Aid

> "I'm calling about the dismantling of USAID. The world's largest foreign aid agency was shut down with no transition plan, stranding aid workers, collapsing supply chains, and putting millions of lives at risk. Programs addressing HIV/AIDS, maternal health, famine, and democracy were terminated overnight. I urge [NAME] to demand the restoration of USAID and hold hearings on the humanitarian impact. [Learn more](/learn/usaid-foreign-aid)"

### Public Health & WHO Withdrawal

> "I'm calling about the withdrawal from the World Health Organization and the dismantling of public health infrastructure. WHO is our early warning system for pandemics. NIH faces a proposed 40% budget cut. RFK Jr. is directing HHS to pursue anti-vaccine policies. Career scientists are being fired from CDC and FDA. I urge [NAME] to restore NIH funding, hold oversight hearings on HHS, and require congressional approval for WHO withdrawal. [Learn more](/learn/public-health)"

### Climate & Environment

> "I'm calling about the rollback of environmental protections. The U.S. has withdrawn from the Paris Climate Agreement for the second time. The EPA has been gutted, methane regulations reversed, public lands opened to unlimited drilling, and the social cost of carbon set to near-zero. I urge [NAME] to support the EPA's independence, restore climate regulations, and oppose the sale of public lands. [Learn more](/learn/climate-environment)"

### LGBTQ+ Rights

> "I'm calling about executive orders targeting LGBTQ+ Americans. The administration has banned transgender military service, eliminated federal gender identity protections, directed schools to discriminate against transgender students, and redefined sex to exclude gender identity under Title IX. I urge [NAME] to support the Equality Act and oppose discriminatory executive actions. [Learn more](/learn/lgbtq-rights)"

### Voting Rights

> "I'm calling about threats to voting rights. Voter purges have removed eligible voters from rolls, polling places are being closed in minority communities, election workers are facing threats, and partisan gerrymandering is denying equal representation. I urge [NAME] to support the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. [Learn more](/learn/voting-rights)"

### Supreme Court Ethics

> "I'm calling about Supreme Court ethics. Justice Thomas accepted undisclosed gifts worth millions from Harlan Crow. Justice Alito accepted luxury travel from Paul Singer. The court has no binding ethics code. I urge [NAME] to support the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act requiring binding ethics rules and financial disclosure. [Learn more](/learn/supreme-court)"

### Impoundment & Fund Withholding

> "I'm calling about the illegal withholding of congressionally appropriated funds. The administration is violating the Impoundment Control Act by refusing to release funds that Congress has appropriated. Multiple courts have ordered the release of withheld funds, and the administration has defied those orders. This is a direct assault on Congress's power of the purse. I urge [NAME] to enforce the Impoundment Control Act and hold the administration in contempt if necessary. [Learn more](/learn/impoundment)"

### Foreign Aggression

> "I'm calling about the administration's foreign aggression. The President has threatened to annex Greenland and seize the Panama Canal, destabilized NATO alliances, abandoned Ukraine, and threatened military action against allies. I urge [NAME] to reaffirm Article 5 commitments, support Ukraine aid, and reassert congressional authority over territorial acquisitions and military action. [Learn more](/learn/foreign-aggression)"

### Trump Financial Conflicts

> "I'm calling about the President's financial conflicts of interest. The $TRUMP crypto coin generated over $100 million. Saudi-funded deals benefit the Trump Organization. Taxpayer money flows to Trump properties. Foreign governments book Trump hotels to curry favor. I urge [NAME] to support a modern emoluments enforcement mechanism and demand full financial disclosure. [Learn more](/learn/trump-financial-conflicts)"

### Project 2025

> "I'm calling about the implementation of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's 920-page blueprint for restructuring the federal government. The administration has implemented over 60% of its recommendations across every agency. I urge [NAME] to hold hearings on Project 2025 implementation and oppose the dismantling of federal agencies and protections. [Learn more](/learn/project-2025)"

### Immigration & Due Process

> "I'm calling to urge [NAME] to defend due process protections for all people on U.S. soil. I oppose enforcement actions that bypass judicial review. The Constitution applies to everyone, regardless of immigration status."

### Medicaid & Healthcare

> "I'm calling about the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's impact on Medicaid. The 6-month reverification requirement and provider tax ban will cause millions to lose coverage. I urge [NAME] to support legislation protecting Medicaid access."

### DHS Funding & Oversight

> "I'm calling about H.R. 7147, the DHS Appropriations Act. Two U.S. citizens have been killed by federal agents in Minneapolis this month. I urge [NAME] to demand oversight and accountability measures before voting for increased enforcement funding."

### Civil Service Protections

> "I'm calling about Schedule F and Executive Order 14171. Converting 50,000 career civil servants to at-will employees destroys institutional expertise and enables political retaliation. I urge [NAME] to support the Saving the Civil Service Act."

### Vaccine Access

> "I'm calling about HHS's changes to the childhood vaccine schedule. Removing vaccines from the routine list has triggered pharmacy access restrictions in 25 states. I urge [NAME] to support legislation decoupling federal recommendations from state practice laws."

1. **Call regularly** - Once a week on your priority issue
2. **Be polite and specific** - Staff appreciate informed, respectful constituents
3. **Follow up** - "I called last week about X. Has the [Senator/Rep] taken a position?"
4. **Attend town halls** - In-person interactions matter

### Join a Calling Group

Organizations that coordinate constituent pressure:

- [Indivisible](https://indivisible.org/) - Local chapters nationwide
- [Swing Left](https://swingleft.org/) - Targeted calling campaigns
