## Email Your Representatives

### Email Your Senators - Demand DOGE Oversight

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Demand congressional oversight of DOGE"
  repType="senator"
  body={`Dear Senator {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to urge you to demand congressional oversight of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

DOGE has fired over 260,000 federal employees, accessed Treasury systems controlling $6.8 trillion in annual payments, and operates with zero transparency. Elon Musk's $15 billion in government contracts create an unprecedented conflict of interest.

The Constitution grants Congress the power to determine executive branch structure and spending. DOGE is bypassing this authority entirely.

I urge you to:
- Support congressional hearings on DOGE operations
- Demand GAO audits of all DOGE actions and contracts
- Restore congressional oversight of federal workforce decisions

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}
/>

### Email Your Representative - ICE Accountability

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Demand accountability for ICE detention practices"
  repType="representative"
  body={`Dear Representative {repName},

I am writing from {zipCode} to urge you to demand accountability for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention practices.

Two U.S. citizens have been killed by federal agents in Minneapolis this month. The detention population has doubled since January 2025. U.S. citizens and legal residents are being wrongfully detained and deported.

ICE revoked the sensitive locations policy that protected schools, churches, and hospitals from enforcement actions.

I urge you to:
- Support oversight hearings on ICE detention practices
- Demand due process protections for all detainees
- Reinstate the sensitive locations policy

The Constitution guarantees due process to all persons on U.S. soil, regardless of immigration status.

Thank you for your leadership.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}
