## Quick Actions

### Find Your Representatives

**Federal:**
- [House.gov - Find Your Representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)
- [Senate.gov - Find Your Senators](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm)

**Fastest Method:** Text your zip code to [Resistbot](https://resist.bot/) at **50409**

### Make a Phone Call

**Why calling works:**
- Calls are logged and tallied by staff
- High call volume signals constituent priority
- Direct human interaction is harder to ignore than emails

**Call Script Template:**
> "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY/ZIP]. I'm calling to urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to [SPECIFIC ASK]. [ONE SENTENCE on why this matters to you personally]. Thank you for your time."

**Pro Tips:**
- Be brief (under 30 seconds)
- State your zip code clearly
- Ask to be logged on the issue
- Call the DC office for policy; local office for casework

## Issue-Specific Scripts

### Immigration & Due Process

> "I'm calling to urge [NAME] to defend due process protections for all people on U.S. soil. I oppose enforcement actions that bypass judicial review. The Constitution applies to everyone, regardless of immigration status."

### Medicaid & Healthcare

> "I'm calling about the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's impact on Medicaid. The 6-month reverification requirement and provider tax ban will cause millions to lose coverage. I urge [NAME] to support legislation protecting Medicaid access."

### DHS Funding & Oversight

> "I'm calling about H.R. 7147, the DHS Appropriations Act. Two U.S. citizens have been killed by federal agents in Minneapolis this month. I urge [NAME] to demand oversight and accountability measures before voting for increased enforcement funding."

### Civil Service Protections

> "I'm calling about Schedule F and Executive Order 14171. Converting 50,000 career civil servants to at-will employees destroys institutional expertise and enables political retaliation. I urge [NAME] to support the Saving the Civil Service Act."

### Vaccine Access

> "I'm calling about HHS's changes to the childhood vaccine schedule. Removing vaccines from the routine list has triggered pharmacy access restrictions in 25 states. I urge [NAME] to support legislation decoupling federal recommendations from state practice laws."

## Sustained Actions

### Build a Relationship with Staff

Congressional staff remember repeat callers. To maximize impact:

1. **Call regularly** - Once a week on your priority issue
2. **Be polite and specific** - Staff appreciate informed, respectful constituents
3. **Follow up** - "I called last week about X. Has the [Senator/Rep] taken a position?"
4. **Attend town halls** - In-person interactions matter

### Join a Calling Group

Organizations that coordinate constituent pressure:

- [Indivisible](https://indivisible.org/) - Local chapters nationwide
- [Swing Left](https://swingleft.org/) - Targeted calling campaigns
- [MoveOn](https://moveon.org/) - Issue-based mobilization

### Write Op-Eds and Letters to the Editor

Your local newspaper reaches your representative's office. Guidelines:
- Keep it under 200 words (letters) or 600 words (op-eds)
- Reference local impact
- Include your credentials if relevant
- Submit to multiple papers
