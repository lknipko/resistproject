# Support Supreme Court Reform

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Demand enforceable ethics rules for Supreme Court justices, support legislation for term limits and court reform, and hold elected officials accountable for their positions on judicial accountability.

The Supreme Court operates under a voluntary ethics code with no enforcement mechanism -- the only branch of government without binding ethics rules. Justices have accepted millions in undisclosed gifts, refused to recuse from cases involving personal conflicts, and faced zero consequences. Congress has the power to change this, but only if constituents demand it.

## Quick Actions

### Email Your Representatives

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Support Enforceable Supreme Court Ethics Rules"
  repType="senator"
  body={`Dear Senator {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to urge you to support enforceable ethics rules for the Supreme Court.

ProPublica's investigations documented over $4 million in undisclosed gifts to Justice Thomas from billionaire Harlan Crow, including luxury travel, real estate transactions, and private school tuition payments. Justice Alito accepted an undisclosed fishing trip from a hedge fund manager who later had a case before the Court -- and Alito voted in his favor without recusing.

The Supreme Court's November 2023 ethics code contains no enforcement mechanism, no complaint process, and no consequences for violations. It is the only branch of the federal government without binding ethics rules.

I urge you to:

1. Co-sponsor the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act
2. Support creating an independent body to investigate ethics complaints against justices
3. Require public justification for recusal decisions
4. Strengthen financial disclosure requirements and enforcement

66% of Americans support a binding ethics code for Supreme Court justices (Marquette Law School Poll, 2023). This is not a partisan issue -- it is about restoring public trust in our judicial system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}

### Call Your Representatives

<CallRepButton
  repType="senator"
  script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge Senator {repName} to support enforceable ethics rules for the Supreme Court.

Justice Thomas accepted over $4 million in undisclosed gifts from a billionaire donor. Justice Alito accepted a luxury trip from a hedge fund manager who later had a case before the Court. The Supreme Court's current ethics code has no enforcement mechanism and no consequences for violations.

I urge Senator {repName} to co-sponsor and support the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act, which would create binding ethics rules with an independent enforcement mechanism.

Every other federal judge in America is bound by enforceable ethics rules. Supreme Court justices should be held to the same standard. Thank you.`}
/>

<CallRepButton
  repType="representative"
  script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm calling from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge Representative {repName} to support the Supreme Court Term Limits and Regular Appointments Act.

Life tenure on the Supreme Court was designed for an era when justices served an average of 15 years. Today, justices serve 25-35 years or more, concentrating immense power in unelected officials with no accountability.

18-year term limits with staggered appointments would give every president equal influence over the Court, reduce the stakes of each appointment, and ensure regular democratic input into judicial selection.

I urge Representative {repName} to co-sponsor this legislation. Thank you.`}

   - Views on judicial ethics enforcement
   - Federalist Society membership and activities
