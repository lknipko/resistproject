# Defend the Justice System

## Quick Summary

The DOJ has been transformed from an independent law enforcement agency into a tool of political retaliation. January 6th defendants who assaulted 140 police officers have been pardoned. Career prosecutors are being purged. Judges are under attack. The rule of law depends on citizens demanding accountability from Congress and supporting the institutions fighting back.

## Quick Actions

### Email Your Representatives

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Defend DOJ Independence -- Constituent Request"
  repType="senator"
  body={`Dear Senator {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to urge you to defend the independence of the Department of Justice.

The blanket pardon of approximately 1,500 January 6th defendants -- including people convicted of seditious conspiracy and assaulting over 140 police officers -- has eliminated the deterrent against political violence. Five officers died following the attack. Their assailants are now free.

Simultaneously, the DOJ is being weaponized against the prosecutors who investigated January 6th and against political opponents of the president. The Public Integrity Section -- which has prosecuted corruption by officials of both parties -- has lost its senior leadership. Career prosecutors have been reassigned or forced out for doing their jobs.

I urge you to:

1. Hold oversight hearings on DOJ politicization
2. Demand testimony from Attorney General Bondi
3. Support legislation protecting career prosecutors from retaliation
4. Publicly condemn the use of DOJ to target political opponents
5. Oppose any nominations to DOJ that prioritize loyalty over qualifications

The rule of law depends on DOJ independence. Please act.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}
/>

### Call Your Representatives

<CallRepButton
  repType="senator"
  script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge Senator {repName} to defend the independence of the Department of Justice. The mass pardon of January 6th defendants -- including people who assaulted 140 police officers and were convicted of seditious conspiracy -- undermines the rule of law.

Career prosecutors are being forced out for doing their jobs, and DOJ is being used to investigate political opponents.

I urge the Senator to demand oversight hearings on DOJ politicization and to oppose any DOJ action that targets prosecutors for their prior case assignments. Thank you.`}

### Share Your Concern

**Social Media Templates:**

**Twitter/X:**
```
1,500 January 6th defendants pardoned. People who assaulted 140 police
officers. Seditious conspirators. Five officers died.

Now DOJ is investigating the prosecutors instead.

Call your senators: 202-224-3121. Demand DOJ independence.

**Longer format (Facebook, Instagram, Threads):**
```
On his first day in office, Trump pardoned everyone charged in the
January 6th attack -- including people convicted of seditious conspiracy
and assaulting over 140 police officers with flagpoles, bear spray, and
fire extinguishers. Five officers died.

Now the DOJ is being used to investigate the prosecutors who investigated
January 6th. Career attorneys are being forced out. Federal judges are
being attacked for doing their jobs.

This is not normal. The rule of law depends on citizens speaking up.

Call your senators at 202-224-3121. Tell them to hold oversight hearings
on DOJ politicization.

### Support Capitol Police Officers

The officers who defended the Capitol on January 6th -- and whose attackers have been pardoned -- deserve direct support.

- Amplify the stories and testimony of officers like **Harry Dunn**, **Michael Fanone**, **Aquilino Gonell**, and **Daniel Hodges** who testified publicly about their experiences
- Support legislation providing enhanced benefits for officers injured on January 6th
- Attend events where officers speak publicly about the attack and its aftermath

**The Officers' Own Words:**

Officer **Michael Fanone** (MPD, retired): Suffered a heart attack and traumatic brain injury defending the Capitol. Tasered and beaten by rioters. Has been vocal about the pardons.

Officer **Harry Dunn** (USCP): Testified before the January 6th Committee about being called racial slurs during the attack. Ran for Congress in 2024. Continues to advocate for accountability.

Officer **Aquilino Gonell** (USCP): Suffered injuries requiring multiple surgeries. Has spoken publicly about the impact of the pardons on officer morale.

Officer **Daniel Hodges** (MPD): Pinned in a doorway and crushed by rioters in a video that became iconic footage of the attack. His assailant (Patrick McCaughey III, sentenced to 7.5 years) was pardoned.

### Attend Judicial Nomination Hearings

Federal judicial nominations are confirmed by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Attending hearings sends a message that citizens are watching.

**How to attend:**
- Senate Judiciary Committee hearings are held in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, Room 226
- Check [judiciary.senate.gov](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/) for hearing schedules
- Hearings are also livestreamed on the committee website
- Members of the public can attend in person (first-come, first-served)

**What to watch for:**
- Whether nominees are asked about DOJ independence
- Whether nominees commit to following the law over political direction
- Whether nominees acknowledge the legitimacy of the January 6th investigation
- Whether nominees have prior connections to Trump legal matters

### Support State-Level Accountability

While federal DOJ is compromised, state attorneys general and local district attorneys retain independent authority.

**Support state-level prosecutors:**
- **Fani Willis** (Fulton County DA, Georgia) -- Brought RICO charges against Trump for election interference; now under DOJ investigation for prosecuting the president
- **Alvin Bragg** (Manhattan DA, New York) -- Secured Trump conviction on 34 felony counts; now under political attack
- State attorneys general bringing cases on immigration, environmental, and civil rights issues

**Contact your state attorney general:**
- [National Association of Attorneys General](https://www.naag.org/) -- Find your state AG
- Urge state AGs to maintain independent investigations and resist federal pressure

HEADLINE: The Rule of Law Needs Defenders -- Congress Must Act on DOJ

When President Trump pardoned approximately 1,500 January 6th
defendants -- including people convicted of seditious conspiracy and
assaulting over 140 police officers -- he sent a message: there are
no consequences for political violence.

Five officers died following the attack on the Capitol. Their
assailants now walk free.

But the damage goes beyond pardons. The Department of Justice is
being transformed from an independent law enforcement agency into a
tool of political retaliation. Career prosecutors who investigated
January 6th are being targeted. The Public Integrity Section --
which has prosecuted corruption by officials of both parties for
decades -- has lost its senior leadership. The Attorney General has
created a task force specifically to investigate prior investigations
of the president.

Even conservative judges have spoken out. Judge Royce Lamberth, a
Reagan appointee, called the pardons "an affront to the rule of
law." When judges appointed by Republican presidents are sounding
the alarm, we should listen.

Senator [NAME], you serve on the [relevant committee]. You have the
authority to hold oversight hearings. You can demand testimony from
Attorney General Bondi. You can support legislation protecting
career prosecutors from political retaliation.

The rule of law is not self-sustaining. It requires defenders. Be
one.

[Your name, city]

### Bar Association Statements

The legal profession has responded to DOJ politicization with official statements. Track and share these:

- **American Bar Association** -- Resolutions on DOJ independence and rule of law
- **State bar associations** -- Many have issued statements on judicial independence
- **Federal Bar Association** -- Statements on protecting the federal judiciary
- **Former DOJ officials' open letters** -- Bipartisan letters signed by former AGs, Deputy AGs, and U.S. Attorneys

These statements carry weight because they represent the professional consensus of the legal community, crossing partisan lines.
