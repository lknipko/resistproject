## What We're Demanding

### Accountability Measures

Before voting YES on DHS funding, Senators should demand:

1. **Body cameras on all ICE and CBP officers**
   - Recording required during enforcement operations
   - Footage preserved and available for investigations

2. **Use-of-force reporting**
   - Mandatory reporting of all force incidents
   - Public database of enforcement actions

3. **Independent investigation authority**
   - Inspector General with subpoena power
   - Outside investigators for use-of-force deaths

4. **Limits on enforcement near schools, hospitals, and courts**
   - Sensitive location policies codified in law

5. **Bivens reform**
   - Restore ability to sue federal agents for constitutional violations

### The Minneapolis Pattern

**January 7, 2026:** Renee Nicole Good, 37, U.S. citizen, killed by ICE officer
**January 24, 2026:** Alex Pretti, 37, U.S. citizen, registered nurse, killed by federal agents

Both were U.S. citizens. Neither was an enforcement target. This pattern demands investigation and accountability.

## The Accountability Vacuum

### Why Federal Agents Have Near-Immunity

| State/Local Police | Federal Agents (ICE/CBP) |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Can be sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 | *Bivens* actions severely limited |
| Body camera requirements in many jurisdictions | Inconsistent documentation |
| State/local oversight mechanisms | No equivalent federal oversight |
| Citizen review boards | No comparable structure |

### Legislative Solutions

**Bivens Reform:**
- Restore ability to sue federal agents for constitutional violations
- Create statutory cause of action for damages

**DHS Oversight Act:**
- Independent inspector with investigation authority
- Mandatory use-of-force reporting
- Body camera requirements

### Talking Points

**For calls and meetings:**
1. Two U.S. citizens killed by federal agents in Minneapolis in January 2026
2. Neither was an enforcement target
3. House rejected all oversight amendments
4. Senate must add accountability measures before voting
5. Funding without oversight enables more deaths

### Sample Op-Ed

```
HEADLINE: Minneapolis Deaths Demand DHS Accountability

Two U.S. citizens—Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti—were killed
by federal agents in Minneapolis this month. Neither was an
enforcement target.

The House just passed $64.4 billion for DHS while rejecting
every amendment that would have required body cameras,
use-of-force reporting, or independent investigations.

Senator [NAME] will vote on this bill soon. Before approving
another year of funding, [they] must demand basic accountability
measures. Americans are dying. We need answers, not blank checks.

[Your name, city]
```
