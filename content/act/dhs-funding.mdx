## Quick Actions

### Email Your Representatives

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Demand accountability measures in DHS funding bill"
  repType="senator"
  body={`Dear Senator {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} regarding H.R. 7147, the DHS Appropriations Act.

Two U.S. citizens have been killed by federal agents in Minneapolis this month. The House rejected all oversight amendments to this $64.4 billion funding bill.

Before voting on DHS funding, I urge you to demand:
- Mandatory body cameras for all federal law enforcement
- Public use-of-force reporting requirements
- Independent investigations of deaths in custody
- Restoration of protections for schools, churches, and hospitals

Federal law enforcement must have accountability measures. The Senate is the last chance to add these critical protections.

Thank you for your leadership.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}

## The Accountability Vacuum

### Why Federal Agents Have Near-Immunity

| State/Local Police | Federal Agents (ICE/CBP) |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Can be sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 | *Bivens* actions severely limited |
| Body camera requirements in many jurisdictions | Inconsistent documentation |
| State/local oversight mechanisms | No equivalent federal oversight |
| Citizen review boards | No comparable structure |

### Legislative Solutions

**Bivens Reform:**
- Restore ability to sue federal agents for constitutional violations
- Create statutory cause of action for damages

**DHS Oversight Act:**
- Independent inspector with investigation authority
- Mandatory use-of-force reporting
- Body camera requirements

HEADLINE: Minneapolis Deaths Demand DHS Accountability

Two U.S. citizens—Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti—were killed
by federal agents in Minneapolis this month. Neither was an
enforcement target.

The House just passed $64.4 billion for DHS while rejecting
every amendment that would have required body cameras,
use-of-force reporting, or independent investigations.

Senator [NAME] will vote on this bill soon. Before approving
another year of funding, [they] must demand basic accountability
measures. Americans are dying. We need answers, not blank checks.

[Your name, city]
