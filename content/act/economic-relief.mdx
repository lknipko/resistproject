# Fight the Affordability Crisis

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Demand Congress restore ACA subsidies, oppose tariffs that raise household costs, and address the housing and food affordability crises — while connecting you with personal relief resources available right now. The average American family is paying $6,000-$10,000 more per year than in 2022 due to policy decisions that can be reversed.

## Quick Actions

### Restore ACA Subsidies

The enhanced ACA subsidies expired at the end of 2025 because Congress chose not to extend them. 22 million people saw premiums double overnight. 3.2 million dropped coverage. Congress can fix this with legislation.

<EmailTemplate repType="all">
  <EmailMessage topic="ACA Subsidies" subject="Restore ACA Premium Subsidies — 22 Million Americans Lost Coverage" body={`Dear {repName},

I am writing with urgency about the expiration of the ACA enhanced premium subsidies. Since January 2026, 22 million Americans have faced doubled or tripled health insurance premiums. An estimated 3.2 million people have already dropped coverage.

This was a policy choice — Congress chose not to extend subsidies that were working. The American Rescue Plan and Inflation Reduction Act extensions kept premiums manageable for millions of working families, small business owners, and self-employed Americans who rely on marketplace coverage.

I urge you to:
1. Co-sponsor or support legislation to restore enhanced ACA premium subsidies permanently
2. Oppose any further cuts to Medicaid or ACA that would increase the number of uninsured Americans
3. Hold hearings on the affordability crisis facing Americans who lack employer-sponsored coverage

A family of four now paying $740/month for insurance — up from $250 — cannot absorb that difference. Please act to restore these critical subsidies.

### Oppose Tariffs (Section 122 — 150-Day Deadline)

The Supreme Court struck down IEEPA tariffs in February 2026. Trump immediately pivoted to Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, imposing a 15% global tariff that expires in 150 days. Congress must act before the deadline.

<EmailTemplate repType="all">
  <EmailMessage topic="Tariffs" subject="Act Before the 150-Day Deadline: $1,500/Year Tariff Burden on American Families" body={`Dear {repName},

The Supreme Court ruled IEEPA tariffs unconstitutional (February 2026). Hours later, Trump imposed a new 15% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 — costing the average American household $1,500/year.

Harvard and IMF economists confirm that 97% of tariff costs are paid by American consumers, not foreign suppliers. These are not taxes on China or Canada — they are taxes on American families.

The Section 122 tariff expires in 150 days. I urge you to:
1. Support legislation to prevent renewal or extension of Section 122 tariffs without a genuine balance-of-payments emergency
2. Reassert congressional authority over trade policy (Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to set tariffs)
3. Hold hearings on the combined household cost burden of tariffs + expiring ACA subsidies + housing costs

Working families cannot afford this compounding squeeze. Please act before the 150-day deadline.

### Housing Reform: Oppose Institutional Investor Purchasing

Institutional investors (hedge funds, REITs, private equity) have purchased millions of entry-level single-family homes, reducing supply for first-time buyers and driving up rents. This is a **bipartisan issue** — both Democrats and Republicans have introduced legislation to limit or tax institutional purchases of single-family homes.

<EmailTemplate repType="all">
  <EmailMessage topic="Housing" subject="Support Legislation to Limit Institutional Investor Home Purchases" body={`Dear {repName},

I'm writing about the housing affordability crisis. A key driver is institutional investors purchasing single-family homes at scale — reducing supply for first-time buyers and driving up rents.

The End Hedge Fund Control of American Homes Act and similar bipartisan proposals would limit or tax institutional purchases of single-family homes. This has support across the political spectrum because both parties understand that families — not hedge funds — should own homes.

I urge you to:
1. Co-sponsor or support legislation limiting institutional purchases of single-family homes
2. Support first-time homebuyer programs and down payment assistance
3. Oppose any deregulation that makes it easier for institutional investors to acquire residential housing

Making housing affordable requires addressing supply — and institutional purchasing is a clear supply constraint that Congress can address.

### Share Your Story

Personal stories move policy. Sharing your experience publicly — with your representative, in local media, or on social media — helps connect the policy debate to real-world impact.

- **Tell your story to your representative:** Contact their district office (not just DC) and ask to speak with the constituent services staff
- **Write a letter to your local newspaper:** Local papers often publish letters about constituent economic hardship; this reaches local officials and neighbors
- **Use #AffordabilityGap or #TariffTax** to connect your story to the broader movement
