# Protect Our Environment

## Quick Summary

The EPA has been gutted, the Paris Agreement abandoned, the value of human life removed from pollution regulations, and public lands opened to drilling and mining. But there are concrete, effective actions you can take right now. Submit public comments on proposed rule changes (these are legally required to be considered), call your representatives about specific EPA budget votes, support the organizations filing lawsuits that are blocking rollbacks, and push your state to adopt stronger protections.

## Quick Actions

### Email Your Representatives

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Oppose Paris Agreement Withdrawal"
  repType="senator"
  body={`Dear Senator {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to express strong opposition to the United States withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement (Executive Order 14166).

The U.S. is responsible for 25% of cumulative global CO2 emissions. Our withdrawal undermines global climate action at a time when extreme weather costs American taxpayers over $90 billion annually in insured losses alone. In 2024, the U.S. experienced 27 billion-dollar weather disasters -- a record.

The Paris Agreement was not a burden on American industry. Renewable energy already employs 3.4 million Americans. Solar and wind are the cheapest forms of new electricity generation. Withdrawal isolates us from the fastest-growing global economic sector.

I urge you to support the Senate's authority under the Treaty Clause and to introduce legislation reaffirming U.S. climate commitments.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}
/>

### Call Your Representatives

The EPA budget must pass through Congress. Your call is logged, tallied, and reported to your representative. High call volume demonstrably changes votes.

<CallRepButton repType="all">
  <CallScript topic="EPA Budget Cuts" script={`Hi, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge {repName} to oppose the proposed 65% cut to the EPA budget in the FY2026 appropriations.

The EPA protects the air my family breathes and the water we drink. Cutting Superfund cleanup by 67% leaves toxic waste sites in communities like ours. Cutting state environmental grants by 70% means our state can't enforce clean water standards.

I urge {repName} to fully fund the EPA. Thank you.`} />
  <CallScript topic="Air Quality Standards" script={`Hi, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling about the proposed rollback of PM2.5 fine particulate matter standards. EPA's own analysis shows the current standards prevent thousands of premature deaths each year.

I urge {repName} to oppose any weakening of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Clean air is not a luxury. Thank you.`} />
</CallRepButton>

### Submit Public Comments on Proposed Rollbacks

**Why this matters:** Federal agencies are *legally required* to consider substantive public comments when finalizing rules. Comments that cite specific data, personal impacts, or legal arguments carry more weight than form letters. Courts have overturned rules when agencies failed to adequately respond to public comments.

**How to submit comments on Regulations.gov:**
1. Go to [Regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov)
2. Search for the docket number (see list below)
3. Click "Comment" on the proposed rule
4. Write a substantive comment (see tips below)
5. Submit before the deadline

**Active and Recent Environmental Dockets:**

| Docket | Issue | Agency |
|--------|-------|--------|
| EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0072 | PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standards | EPA |
| EPA-HQ-OW-2022-0801 | PFAS Drinking Water Standards | EPA |
| EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0590 | Power Plant Carbon Emission Standards | EPA |
| EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0668 | Methane Emissions from Oil and Gas | EPA |
| EPA-HQ-OAR-2022-0829 | Vehicle Tailpipe Emission Standards | EPA |
| EPA-HQ-OW-2021-0302 | Lead and Copper Rule Improvements | EPA |
| DOI-BLM-2024-0001 | Oil and Gas Leasing on Federal Lands | BLM |
| BOEM-2024-0001 | Offshore Drilling 5-Year Leasing Program | BOEM |
| FWS-HQ-ES-2023-0018 | Endangered Species Act Critical Habitat | FWS |

**Note:** Docket numbers may change as new proposed rules are published. Always search [Regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov) for the most current dockets. Search terms: "EPA air quality," "PFAS drinking water," "oil gas leasing," "endangered species critical habitat."

**Tips for effective comments:**
- **Be specific** -- Reference the docket number, specific sections of the proposed rule, and cite data
- **Explain personal impact** -- How does this rule affect your community, health, or livelihood?
- **Cite scientific evidence** -- Reference peer-reviewed studies, EPA's own analyses, or health data
- **Address legal requirements** -- Note that the Clean Air Act requires EPA to set standards "requisite to protect the public health" (42 U.S.C. 7409)
- **Avoid form letters** -- Agencies weigh unique, substantive comments more heavily
- **Include your credentials** -- If you have relevant expertise (medical, scientific, legal), note it

**Sample comment structure:**
```
RE: Docket No. [NUMBER] - [Rule Name]

I am writing to oppose the proposed [weakening/repeal] of [specific rule].

[Personal impact: How does this affect you, your family, or your community?]

[Scientific evidence: Cite specific studies or EPA analyses]

[Legal argument: Note statutory requirements the agency must fulfill]

[Specific request: What outcome do you want?]

Respectfully submitted,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
[Your credentials, if relevant]
```

### Support State-Level Environmental Action

With federal protections being dismantled, **state action is now the most important line of defense.** States can set their own environmental standards as long as they are at least as strong as federal standards -- and many are going further.

**What you can do:**
1. **Contact your state legislators** about environmental bills in your state legislature
2. **Support your state attorney general** -- Many state AGs are suing to block federal rollbacks (California, New York, Massachusetts, Washington, Oregon, and others have active litigation)
3. **Push for state adoption of California vehicle emission standards** -- States can adopt California's stricter standards under the Clean Air Act
4. **Advocate for state renewable energy standards** -- 30+ states have renewable portfolio standards that drive clean energy adoption
5. **Support state-level PFAS regulations** -- Several states have adopted stricter PFAS standards than the federal government

**Key state resources:**
- [National Conference of State Legislatures - Environment](https://www.ncsl.org/environment-and-natural-resources) -- Track state environmental legislation
- [State Attorneys General Climate Alliance](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/multi-state-climate-action) -- States suing over federal rollbacks
- [U.S. Climate Alliance](https://usclimatealliance.org/) -- 24 states committed to Paris Agreement goals

---

### Attend Public Hearings

When EPA or other agencies propose rule changes, they often hold public hearings. Your testimony becomes part of the official record and agencies are legally required to respond to it.

**How to find public hearings:**
- Check [Regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov) for hearing notices on proposed rules
- [EPA Public Participation Guide](https://www.epa.gov/international-cooperation/public-participation-guide) -- How to participate in EPA rulemaking
- [Federal Register Daily](https://www.federalregister.gov/) -- New proposed rules and hearing announcements published daily
- Your regional EPA office holds local hearings -- find yours at [EPA Regional Offices](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/visiting-regional-office)

**Tips for testifying at public hearings:**
- Prepare a 3-minute statement (most hearings limit testimony to 3-5 minutes)
- Lead with your personal connection to the issue
- Cite specific data or health impacts
- Bring copies of your statement to submit for the record
- Be respectful but firm

---

### Support Environmental Litigation

Lawsuits are currently the most effective mechanism for blocking environmental rollbacks. Courts have blocked or delayed many proposed rollbacks because agencies failed to follow required procedures.

**Active lawsuits to support (as of February 2026):**

- **Earthjustice v. EPA** -- Challenging power plant emission rule repeal
- **State of California v. EPA** -- Challenging revocation of California's vehicle emission waiver
- **Center for Biological Diversity v. Interior** -- Challenging ANWR drilling leases
- **Sierra Club v. EPA** -- Challenging methane regulation repeal
- **NRDC v. EPA** -- Challenging PM2.5 standard rollback
- **State AGs coalition** -- Challenging 10-for-1 deregulation order

**How to support:**
- Donate to [Earthjustice](https://earthjustice.org/donate) -- they provide free legal representation
- Join as a plaintiff through organizational memberships (many lawsuits are filed on behalf of member organizations)
- Provide expert declarations if you have relevant expertise
- Attend court hearings as a member of the public

### [+] How to Buy a Personal Air Quality Monitor

Low-cost air quality monitors let you track pollution levels at your home. This is especially important as EPA monitoring budgets are cut.

- **PurpleAir PA-II** (~$250) -- Most widely used community sensor; data shared on public map
- **Temtop M10** (~$70) -- Budget option for indoor PM2.5 monitoring
- **IQAir AirVisual Pro** (~$270) -- Indoor/outdoor with historical data

Place outdoor sensors away from direct sources (grills, dryers) and at breathing height. Register your sensor on [PurpleAir's map](https://map.purpleair.com/) to contribute community data.
