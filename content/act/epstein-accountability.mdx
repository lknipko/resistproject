# Demand Epstein Accountability

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Demand full transparency in the Epstein case -- complete release of sealed court documents, prosecution of uncharged co-conspirators, accountability for DOJ and BOP failures, and systemic reforms to prevent wealthy predators from buying impunity. Over 100 identified victims were children when they were abused. Only two people have been federally charged. Thousands of pages remain sealed. The FBI investigative file has not been released. The contents of Epstein's safe have never been disclosed. Congress has not conducted a comprehensive investigation. You can change that.

## Quick Actions

### Email Your Representatives

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Constituent Request: Bipartisan Investigation into the Epstein Case"
  repType="senator"
  body={`Dear Senator {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to request that the Senate Judiciary Committee conduct a comprehensive, bipartisan investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case and the Department of Justice's handling of it.

The documented facts demand investigation:

1. NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT: In 2008, U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta signed a secret agreement that let Epstein plead to state charges (13 months in county jail with work release) while granting blanket immunity to unnamed co-conspirators. Judge Kenneth Marra ruled this violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act. The DOJ Inspector General found "poor judgment" but referred no one for prosecution.

2. DEATH IN CUSTODY: Epstein died at MCC Manhattan on August 10, 2019, before trial. The OIG found guards fell asleep and falsified records, surveillance cameras malfunctioned, he was improperly removed from suicide watch, and his cellmate was transferred the day before -- violating BOP policy. The two guards received deferred prosecution agreements with no prison time.

3. UNCHARGED CO-CONSPIRATORS: Epstein's operation involved numerous associates over decades. Only Ghislaine Maxwell was federally charged. The SDNY said its investigation was "ongoing" in 2019 -- no update has been provided.

4. SEALED RECORDS: The FBI investigative file, the contents of Epstein's safe (CDs and photographs found in 2019), grand jury materials, and portions of civil case documents remain sealed or unreleased.

The Senate Judiciary Committee has the subpoena power to:
- Compel DOJ and FBI to release the investigative file
- Require testimony from current and former prosecutors
- Access sealed and classified materials
- Determine whether co-conspirators should have been charged
- Assess whether wealth and connections influenced the case outcome

Over 100 identified victims were children when they were abused. They deserve a justice system that investigates fully, prosecutes equally, and provides complete transparency.

I urge you to act.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}
/>

### Call Your Representatives

Senators serve on the Judiciary Committee, which has subpoena power over the DOJ and FBI. A bipartisan Senate investigation could access sealed materials, compel testimony, and force disclosure of the FBI investigative file. Congressional staff tally calls by issue -- high volume signals constituent priority.

<CallRepButton repType="senator">
  <CallScript topic="Senate Investigation" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge Senator {repName} to support a comprehensive bipartisan investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case.

Over 100 identified victims were children. Only two people have been federally charged. The FBI investigative file has not been released. The contents of Epstein's safe have never been disclosed. The 2008 non-prosecution agreement granted blanket immunity to unnamed co-conspirators.

The Senate Judiciary Committee has subpoena power to access sealed materials and compel testimony from DOJ officials. I urge the Senator to support a full investigation. Thank you.`} />
  <CallScript topic="Release Sealed Materials" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} from {zipCode}.

I'm calling about the Epstein case. Thousands of pages of court documents remain sealed. The FBI's investigative file has not been released despite FOIA requests. The contents of the safe found in Epstein's Manhattan home -- CDs labeled with names and photographs -- have never been disclosed.

I urge Senator {repName} to demand that the DOJ and FBI release all non-classified Epstein-related materials to the public. Survivors and the American people deserve full transparency. Thank you.`} />
  <CallScript topic="Prosecute Co-Conspirators" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} from {zipCode}.

I'm calling about accountability in the Epstein case. Jeffrey Epstein ran a sex trafficking network for decades with the help of numerous associates. Only Ghislaine Maxwell has been federally charged. The Southern District of New York said its investigation was 'ongoing' in 2019 -- six years later, no additional charges have been filed.

I urge Senator {repName} to demand an update from the DOJ on the status of the investigation and to push for prosecution of any identifiable co-conspirators. No one should be above the law. Thank you.`} />
</CallRepButton>

<CallRepButton
  repType="representative"
  script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge Representative {repName} to support a full House investigation into the Epstein sex trafficking case.

The 2008 non-prosecution agreement brokered by Alexander Acosta let a serial child sex trafficker serve 13 months in county jail with work release and granted blanket immunity to unnamed co-conspirators. The DOJ Inspector General found 'poor judgment' but no one was held accountable. Over 100 victims were children.

The House has the power to investigate. Please use it. Thank you.`}

### Share the Facts

Use these fact-based social media posts to spread awareness. Every claim is sourced from court documents or government reports.

**Post 1 -- The Non-Prosecution Agreement:**
```
In 2008, federal prosecutors let Jeffrey Epstein plead to state charges: 13 months in county jail with work release.

The secret deal also granted blanket immunity to unnamed "co-conspirators."

A federal judge ruled this violated victims' rights.

No one was held accountable for the deal.

Sources: NPA document; Judge Marra ruling (Case 08-80736)
```

**Post 2 -- Only Two People Charged:**
```
Jeffrey Epstein ran a sex trafficking network for decades with numerous associates.

Number of people federally charged: 2
- Epstein (died before trial)
- Maxwell (convicted, 20 years)

Number of other co-conspirators charged: 0

Over 100 identified victims. Two defendants. No accountability for the rest.

Source: SDNY case records
```

**Post 3 -- What's Still Sealed:**
```
Still not released in the Epstein case:

- FBI investigative file
- Contents of safe found in Epstein's home (CDs labeled with names)
- Grand jury materials
- Full financial records
- Surveillance recordings from Epstein properties

Why?

Sources: DOJ OIG reports; FOIA response letters
```

**Post 4 -- The Victims:**
```
Over 100 identified victims. Children when they were abused.

The Victims' Compensation Fund paid out $121M+ from Epstein's estate.

But money is not justice.

No trial. No co-conspirator prosecutions. No full disclosure.

Survivors deserve both compensation AND accountability.

Source: Epstein Victims' Compensation Fund; SDNY records
```

**Post 5 -- Demand Investigation:**
```
The Senate Judiciary Committee has subpoena power over the DOJ and FBI.

It can:
- Compel release of the FBI investigative file
- Access sealed materials
- Force testimony from prosecutors
- Investigate why co-conspirators weren't charged

It hasn't.

Call: 202-224-3121

Tell your Senator to investigate.

## Sustained Actions

### File FOIA Requests

The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. ss 552) gives you the legal right to request federal agency records. Filing FOIA requests is one of the most powerful tools available to individual citizens for forcing government transparency.

**What to Request:**

**1. FBI Investigative File**

Target agency: Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
```
FOIA/PA Section
Record/Information Dissemination Section
170 Marcel Drive
Winchester, VA 22602

Re: FOIA Request -- Jeffrey Epstein Investigation Records

Dear FOIA Officer:

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, I hereby request access to the following records:

1. All records from the FBI's investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, including but not limited to:
   a. Investigative reports and memoranda
   b. Interview transcripts and witness statements
   c. Evidence logs and chain of custody documents
   d. Communications between FBI personnel regarding the investigation
   e. Records of evidence collected from Epstein's residences

2. All records relating to the contents of the safe recovered from Jeffrey Epstein's residence at 9 East 71st Street, New York, NY, during the July 2019 search, including descriptions, inventories, and any analysis of materials found therein.

3. All records relating to any investigation of Jeffrey Epstein's associates or co-conspirators.

I am requesting a fee waiver pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) on the grounds that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

I am willing to pay up to $[25/50/100] in fees if a waiver is not granted. Please contact me before incurring fees above this amount.

If any responsive records or portions thereof are withheld, please provide an index of withheld records (a Vaughn index) citing the specific exemption(s) relied upon for each withholding.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this request. I look forward to your response within the 20 business days required by statute.

Sincerely,

```

**Submit online:** [BOP FOIA Portal](https://www.bop.gov/foia/)

**FOIA Tips:**

- **Be specific** -- The more precisely you describe the records, the harder it is for agencies to claim they cannot identify them
- **Use MuckRock** -- [MuckRock.com](https://www.muckrock.com/) is a free platform that helps you draft, submit, and track FOIA requests. They also publish results publicly.
- **Expect delays** -- Agencies often take months or years to respond. Follow up regularly.
- **Appeal denials** -- If your request is denied, you have the right to an administrative appeal. Many denials are overturned on appeal.
- **Litigation** -- If appeals fail, organizations like the [Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press](https://www.rcfp.org/) and [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/) sometimes litigate FOIA denials pro bono.
- **Fees** -- Most requests are free. Request a fee waiver citing public interest. If denied, fees are usually modest (10 cents/page for copies).

### Fund Investigative Journalism

The Epstein case was broken open not by prosecutors but by **journalists**. Julie K. Brown's 2018 "Perversion of Justice" series in the Miami Herald directly led to the SDNY reopening the case. Investigative journalism remains the most effective mechanism for holding power accountable.

### Support Legal Reform

The Epstein case exposed specific, fixable failures in federal law. Supporting these reforms prevents future cases from following the same pattern.

**Key Legislative Reforms:**

**1. Strengthening the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA)**
- Judge Marra ruled the Epstein NPA violated the CVRA, but the ruling came too late to undo the deal
- Reform needed: Require judicial approval for NPAs in sex trafficking cases before they are finalized
- Reform needed: Mandatory victim notification with sufficient time to object
- Reform needed: Meaningful enforcement mechanism when prosecutors violate the CVRA

**2. Ending Secret Non-Prosecution Agreements**
- The Epstein NPA was negotiated in secret and sealed from victims
- Reform needed: Prohibit sealing NPAs in cases involving crimes against minors
- Reform needed: Require that all co-conspirator immunity provisions be reviewed by a judge

**3. Bureau of Prisons Reform**
- Epstein's death exposed chronic BOP failures: understaffing, falsified records, broken cameras
- Reform needed: Mandatory staffing ratios for high-profile detainees
- Reform needed: Independent camera monitoring (not controlled by the same unit)
- Reform needed: Congressional BOP oversight board with inspection authority

**4. Statute of Limitations Reform**
- Some Epstein-related crimes may be barred by expired statutes of limitations
- Reform needed: Eliminate statutes of limitations for sex trafficking of minors
- Several states have already enacted such reforms; federal law should follow

**How to support these reforms:**
1. Call your representatives and ask them to introduce or co-sponsor relevant legislation
2. Support organizations lobbying for these reforms:
   - [National Crime Victim Law Institute](https://law.lclark.edu/centers/national_crime_victim_law_institute/)
   - [National Center for Victims of Crime](https://victimsofcrime.org/)
   - [Polaris Project](https://polarisproject.org/) (trafficking-specific)
3. Write letters to the editor about the need for reform, citing the Epstein case as the reason
4. Testify at state legislative hearings on statute of limitations reform

## New Actions: February 2026 Developments

### DOJ Epstein Library Is Now Live

The DOJ published 3.5 million pages of Epstein-related documents following the Epstein Files Transparency Act (H.R. 4405, signed Nov. 19, 2025). You can now research primary source materials directly:

- **[DOJ Epstein Document Library](https://www.justice.gov/epstein)** — Browse the full release
- **Report botched redactions:** If you find documents that appear to expose victim information, report to the DOJ Inspector General: [oig.justice.gov](https://oig.justice.gov)
- **Amplify survivor organizations** demanding properly redacted re-release that protects victim identities

### Demand Full Accountability — Including Missing Trump-Related Files

Congressional Republicans launched an inquiry (Feb. 25, 2026) into why certain files allegedly related to Trump associates were not included in the DOJ release. This is a rare bipartisan accountability opportunity — contact your representatives to demand the inquiry be thorough and include all co-conspirators, regardless of political affiliation.

<EmailTemplate repType="all">
  <EmailMessage topic="Epstein Files" subject="Demand Complete Epstein Accountability — Including Missing Files" body={`Dear {repName},

I'm writing about the DOJ's release of Epstein documents under the Epstein Files Transparency Act. While I support the release, I have two urgent concerns:

1. Reports indicate that files related to certain associates were withheld from the release. I urge you to support the Congressional inquiry and demand DOJ explain every omission.

2. The release included botched redactions that exposed victim information, violating survivor privacy. Please demand DOJ conduct a proper re-release that protects victims while maintaining transparency.

True accountability requires complete transparency — no politically motivated omissions, full co-conspirator investigation, and survivor protection. Only two people have been federally charged despite documented evidence of a large network. That must change.

Please support the pending investigations and demand DOJ provide a full accounting of what was withheld and why.

Respectfully,

### Follow European Accountability Developments

European countries are taking stronger accountability actions following the document release (Peter Mandelson arrested in UK; Prince Andrew questioned; multiple government investigations opened). You can:
- **Amplify European actions** on social media to contrast with limited U.S. accountability
- **Contact your representatives** urging them to pursue comparable investigations
- **Support organizations** working on international trafficking accountability: [Polaris Project](https://polarisproject.org), [ECPAT USA](https://www.ecpatusa.org)
