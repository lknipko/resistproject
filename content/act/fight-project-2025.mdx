# Fight the Implementation of Project 2025

## Quick Summary

Project 2025 is being implemented across every federal agency simultaneously, which means fighting it requires action on multiple fronts. The most effective resistance targets the specific proposals that require Congressional action (department eliminations, budget cuts, entitlement restructuring) because those can still be stopped. Executive actions already taken can be challenged through litigation, state-level resistance, and sustained political pressure. Below are concrete actions organized by urgency and time commitment.

## Quick Actions

### Call Congress About Project 2025

The proposals that require Congressional action can still be stopped. Call your representatives about specific P2025 proposals currently before Congress.

**General Project 2025 Script:**
> "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY/ZIP]. I'm calling because the administration is systematically implementing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 blueprint. Despite the president's claims of not knowing about this plan, at least 66 of its authors now hold government positions. I urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to oppose all legislation advancing Project 2025 proposals, including the elimination of the Department of Education, further Medicaid cuts, and any expansion of Schedule F. Thank you."

**Schedule F / Civil Service Script:**
> "I'm calling about the implementation of Schedule F under Executive Order 14171. This Project 2025 proposal would strip civil service protections from over 50,000 career federal employees. I urge [NAME] to support the Saving the Civil Service Act and oppose any appropriations that fund Schedule F reclassifications."

**Department of Education Script:**
> "I'm calling about the Project 2025 proposal to eliminate the Department of Education. Legislation has been introduced, and I urge [NAME] to vote against any bill that abolishes, defunds, or restructures the department. Title I funding, student loan programs, and civil rights enforcement must be maintained."

**Environmental Protection Script:**
> "I'm calling about the gutting of the EPA under Project 2025. The administration has eliminated the Office of Environmental Justice, withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, and repealed methane regulations -- all proposals from the Heritage Foundation blueprint. I urge [NAME] to oppose any budget that cuts EPA funding and to support legislation restoring environmental protections."

**How to call:**
- **House Switchboard:** 202-225-3121
- **Senate Switchboard:** 202-224-3121
- [Find Your Representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)
- [Find Your Senators](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm)
- Text your zip code to [Resistbot](https://resist.bot/) at **50409**

[See: [Contact Congress](/act/contact-congress) for more calling tips and scripts]

### Email Your Representatives

**Subject:** Oppose Project 2025 Implementation

**Template:**
```
Dear [Representative/Senator NAME],

I am writing as your constituent from [CITY, ZIP] about the
systematic implementation of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025
blueprint across the federal government.

Despite the president's campaign claims of having "nothing to do
with" Project 2025, at least 66 of its authors now hold government
positions, and the administration has enacted the majority of the
document's key proposals -- from Schedule F (EO 14171) to the
elimination of environmental justice offices to the gutting of
Medicaid through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

I urge you to:
- Vote against any legislation that advances Project 2025 proposals
- Support the Saving the Civil Service Act to protect career
  federal employees from political purges
- Demand oversight hearings on the Heritage Foundation's role in
  staffing and directing federal agencies
- Oppose any budget that eliminates the Department of Education,
  cuts EPA funding, or defunds climate research

The American public rejected Project 2025 during the campaign. It
should not be implemented through the back door.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
```

**Send via:**
- [Resistbot](https://resist.bot/) -- Text RESIST to 50409 to send to all your representatives
- [5 Calls](https://5calls.org) -- Issue-specific calling and emailing
- Direct email through [House.gov](https://www.house.gov/) and [Senate.gov](https://www.senate.gov/) member pages

### Share the Document

One of the most effective actions is ensuring people know what Project 2025 actually says. The document is public and available for anyone to read.

**Share these links:**
- [Full Mandate for Leadership document](https://www.project2025.org/playbook/)
- [ACLU Project 2025 Explainer](https://www.aclu.org/project-2025-explained)
- [Learn page on this site](/learn/project-2025)

**Social media template:**
> Project 2025 is a 922-page blueprint for restructuring the federal government, written by people who now run the agencies they planned to dismantle. Trump said he "knew nothing about it." At least 66 of its authors now hold government positions. Read it yourself: https://www.project2025.org/playbook/

**Key talking points when sharing:**
- The document is public -- anyone can read it and verify claims
- Trump denied knowing about it, but Heritage Foundation's president publicly claimed credit for its implementation
- The authors wrote the plan, then were appointed to implement it
- This is not normal policy transition -- it is pre-planned institutional capture

### Submit Public Comments

Many Project 2025 proposals require federal rulemaking, which means mandatory public comment periods. Your comments become part of the legal record.

**How to submit:**
1. Visit [Regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov)
2. Search for relevant rulemakings (Schedule F, EPA rollbacks, Title IX changes, etc.)
3. Submit a substantive comment explaining how the rule affects you

**Tips for effective comments:**
- Be specific about which rule you are commenting on
- Explain personal or professional impact
- Reference factual evidence or expertise
- Substantive comments carry more legal weight than form letters
- Comments become part of the administrative record used in litigation

**Current comment opportunities (check Regulations.gov for deadlines):**
- OPM Schedule F / Schedule Policy-Career rulemaking
- EPA regulatory rollbacks
- Department of Education Title IX revisions
- HHS reproductive health regulations

### Support Legal Challenges

Many Project 2025 implementations are being challenged in court. Legal challenges are among the most effective tools for slowing or blocking implementation.

**Active Litigation Areas:**
- **Schedule F:** NTEU and other unions challenging EO 14171
- **Birthright Citizenship:** Multiple federal courts have blocked EO 14160
- **Environmental Rollbacks:** Earthjustice, Sierra Club, and state AGs challenging EPA reversals

- **DOGE Actions:** Multiple lawsuits challenging mass terminations and data access

**How to support:**
- Donate to litigation organizations (Earthjustice, ACLU, Democracy Forward, NTEU)

- Attend court hearings to show public interest
- Share litigation updates to build public support

[→ Take Action: Join Litigation](/act/join-litigation)

### State and Local Resistance

When federal agencies are captured by the P2025 agenda, state and local governments become the last line of defense.

**What states can do:**
- State attorneys general can sue to block federal overreach
- States can maintain their own environmental standards (California emissions standards, state climate plans)
- States can protect immigrants through sanctuary policies and state-funded legal defense
- States can maintain education standards and funding regardless of federal DOE changes
- States can protect reproductive rights through state law

**What you can do at the state level:**
- Contact your state attorney general to join multi-state lawsuits
- Attend state legislature sessions on environmental, education, and healthcare policy
- Support state-level ballot initiatives protecting rights threatened by P2025
- Run for local office -- school boards, city councils, and county commissions make critical decisions about local implementation of federal mandates

**What cities and counties can do:**
- Adopt sanctuary policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement
- Maintain local environmental standards and clean energy commitments
- Support public schools and public libraries targeted by P2025 proposals
- Refuse to use local law enforcement for federal immigration operations

When discussing Project 2025 with others, focus on these verifiable facts:

1. **"The document exists and is public."** Anyone can read the 922-page Mandate for Leadership at project2025.org.
2. **"Trump denied knowing about it."** He said "I know nothing about Project 2025" on July 5, 2024. Heritage Foundation is run by his longtime advisors.
3. **"The authors got the jobs."** At least 66 P2025 contributors were appointed to government positions, many heading the agencies they wrote plans to restructure.
4. **"The proposals are being enacted."** The administration has implemented the majority of the document's key recommendations across immigration, environment, education, healthcare, and civil service.
5. **"It affects everyone."** This is not just about immigration or the environment -- it restructures how the entire federal government works, from weather forecasts to student loans to workplace safety.
