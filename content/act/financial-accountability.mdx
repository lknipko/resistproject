# Demand Financial Accountability

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Demand transparency and accountability for unprecedented presidential financial conflicts of interest. The Trump family's crypto ventures, Saudi deals, and business entanglements represent the most extensive self-enrichment through public office in American history. You can fight back by pressuring Congress, supporting watchdog organizations, filing ethics complaints, and funding investigative journalism.

## Quick Actions

### Call Your Representative About Corruption

**Why it works:** Congressional staff tally calls by issue. High call volume on corruption signals constituent priority and builds pressure for oversight hearings. Your call takes 2 minutes.

**Script -- General Corruption/Conflicts:**

<CallScript>
"Hello, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [ZIP CODE]. I'm calling to urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to demand oversight hearings on the president's financial conflicts of interest. The president launched a cryptocurrency that earned his affiliated entities billions while simultaneously signing executive orders benefiting the crypto industry. Foreign governments continue spending millions at Trump properties. I urge [NAME] to support legislation requiring presidential divestiture and to demand subpoena power for investigating these conflicts. Thank you."
</CallScript>

**Script -- Crypto Conflicts Specifically:**

<CallScript>
"Hello, my name is [NAME] from [ZIP CODE]. I'm calling about the president's cryptocurrency conflicts of interest. Three days before inauguration, Trump launched a memecoin where his entities control 80% of the supply. He then signed pro-crypto executive orders and hosted a dinner for top token holders at his golf club. This is selling presidential access. I urge [NAME] to support the bipartisan ETHICS Act to ban elected officials from launching financial products. Thank you."
</CallScript>

**Script -- Saudi Arabia/Foreign Payments:**

<CallScript>
"Hello, my name is [NAME] from [ZIP CODE]. I'm calling about foreign government payments to the Trump family. Jared Kushner received $2 billion from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund after serving as a senior White House advisor. Saudi-backed LIV Golf holds tournaments at Trump properties. I urge [NAME] to support the Foreign Emoluments Accountability Act and demand financial disclosure from all senior officials and their family members. Thank you."
</CallScript>

**Who to call:**
- Find your Representative: [House.gov](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)
- Find your Senators: [Senate.gov](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm)
- **House Switchboard:** 202-225-3121
- **Senate Switchboard:** 202-224-3121

**Key Congressional Committees to contact:**
- Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (oversight)
- House Committee on Oversight and Accountability
- Senate Banking Committee (crypto regulation)
- Senate Finance Committee (tax/financial disclosure)

### Send an Email About Conflicts of Interest

**Subject:** Demand Oversight of Presidential Financial Conflicts -- [YOUR CITY] Constituent

```
Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as your constituent from [City, State, ZIP] to urge you to take action on the president's unprecedented financial conflicts of interest.

The documented facts are deeply troubling:

- The president launched a cryptocurrency three days before taking office that generated a $14+ billion market cap, with his affiliated entities controlling 80% of the supply
- His son-in-law received $2 billion from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund after serving as a senior White House advisor
- Foreign governments continue spending millions at Trump properties
- The president signed pro-crypto executive orders while personally profiting from cryptocurrency ventures
- He hosted a dinner at his golf club for top holders of his memecoin, explicitly linking presidential access to financial purchases

These are not partisan allegations -- they are documented in SEC filings, blockchain records, Congressional investigations, and government accountability reports.

I urge you to:

1. Support oversight hearings on presidential conflicts of interest
2. Co-sponsor legislation requiring presidential divestiture
3. Support the ETHICS Act banning officials from launching financial products
4. Demand enforcement of the Emoluments Clause

The Constitution exists to prevent exactly this kind of self-enrichment through public office. Please act.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[Your Phone -- optional]
```

### Share the Facts

Use these fact-based social media posts to spread awareness. Every claim includes a verifiable source.

**Post 1 -- The $TRUMP Memecoin:**
```
Three days before inauguration, Trump launched a memecoin where his entities control 80% of the supply. It hit a $14B+ market cap.

Then he signed pro-crypto executive orders.

Then he hosted a dinner for top token holders at his golf club.

This is selling presidential access.

Source: SEC records, blockchain data, Reuters
```

**Post 2 -- The Saudi Connection:**
```
Jared Kushner left the White House and received $2 billion from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund -- over the objections of the fund's own screening panel.

Steve Mnuchin got $1 billion from the same fund.

Saudi-backed LIV Golf pays to use Trump properties.

Follow the money.

Source: NYT investigation, House Oversight Committee
```

**Post 3 -- No Blind Trust:**
```
Every modern president placed assets in a blind trust:
- Carter: peanut farm
- Bush: investments
- Clinton: investments
- Obama: index funds

Trump: maintained full ownership of a global real estate, media, and crypto empire.

Not incremental. Categorical.

Source: Office of Government Ethics
```

**Post 4 -- Foreign Government Spending:**
```
Foreign governments spent millions at Trump properties while the president made policy affecting those countries:

Saudi Arabia: $270K+ at Trump Hotel DC
Kuwait: Moved national celebration to Trump Hotel
Qatar: $6.5M purchase in Trump Tower

The Emoluments Clause exists for exactly this reason.

## Sustained Actions

### Support Anti-Corruption Organizations

These organizations do the heavy lifting of investigation, litigation, and accountability. Your support funds their work.

| Organization | Focus | How to Help |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **[CREW](https://www.citizensforethics.org/)** (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington) | Legal challenges, investigations, FOIA requests, emoluments litigation | [Donate](https://www.citizensforethics.org/donate/), follow their reports |
| **[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/)** | Investigative journalism, "Paying the President" database tracking Trump property spending | [Donate](https://www.propublica.org/donate), share investigations |
| **[POGO](https://www.pogo.org/)** (Project on Government Oversight) | Government accountability, whistleblower protection, spending oversight | [Donate](https://www.pogo.org/donate), volunteer |
| **[Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/)** | Government transparency, open data, campaign finance disclosure | [Donate](https://sunlightfoundation.com/donate/) |
| **[OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/)** | Campaign finance tracking, lobbying disclosure, dark money investigations | [Donate](https://www.opensecrets.org/about/donate), use their data |
| **[Public Citizen](https://www.citizen.org/)** | Ethics reform, anti-corruption legislation, corporate accountability | [Donate](https://www.citizen.org/support-public-citizen/) |
| **[Common Cause](https://www.commoncause.org/)** | Election integrity, ethics reform, government accountability | [Join](https://www.commoncause.org/join/) your state chapter |

**Why donations matter:** These organizations operate on public donations. A single FOIA request can cost thousands in legal fees. CREW's emoluments lawsuits cost hundreds of thousands. Your $25 or $50 contribution directly funds accountability work that no one else is doing.

---

### File Ethics Complaints

You can file formal ethics complaints about specific conflicts of interest. Here is how:

**Office of Government Ethics (OGE)**

- Website: [oge.gov](https://www.oge.gov/)
- OGE oversees the executive branch ethics program
- Can receive complaints about financial disclosure violations
- Contact: 202-482-9300

**Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE)**

- Website: [oce.house.gov](https://oce.house.gov/)
- Reviews allegations of misconduct by House members and staff
- File complaints online or by mail
- Particularly relevant for members who block oversight of corruption

**State Ethics Commissions**

- If you live in New York, Florida (Mar-a-Lago), New Jersey (Bedminster), or Virginia (Trump Winery), your state ethics commission may have jurisdiction over Trump Organization activities in your state
- Find your state ethics commission: [National Conference of State Legislatures - Ethics](https://www.ncsl.org/ethics)

**SEC Whistleblower Program**

- If you have information about securities violations related to $TRUMP, $MELANIA, WLFI, or DJT stock
- Awards 10-30% of sanctions exceeding $1 million
- File a tip: [sec.gov/whistleblower](https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower)
- Can file anonymously through an attorney

---

### Fund Investigative Journalism

Investigative journalism is the primary mechanism by which presidential corruption is exposed. Most of the facts on the [Learn page](/learn/trump-financial-conflicts) were uncovered by reporters. Support the outlets doing this work.

**Newsrooms with active Trump financial investigations:**

| Outlet | Focus | Support |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/)** | "Paying the President" database, financial investigations | [Donate](https://www.propublica.org/donate) (nonprofit) |
| **[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)** | Kushner/Saudi investigation, Trump tax returns | [Subscribe](https://www.nytimes.com/subscription) |
| **[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/)** | Foreign government spending, emoluments investigations | [Subscribe](https://www.washingtonpost.com/subscribe) |
| **[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/)** | Crypto conflicts, WLFI investigations | [Subscribe](https://www.reuters.com/) |
| **[The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/)** | Government accountability, financial conflicts | [Donate](https://theintercept.com/donate) (nonprofit) |
| **[Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/)** | Dark money, corruption investigations | [Donate](https://www.motherjones.com/donate) (nonprofit) |

**Local investigative journalism** is equally critical. If you live near a Trump property (Mar-a-Lago, Bedminster, Doral, Trump Tower), support your local newspaper -- they cover impacts that national outlets miss.

---

### Support Campaign Finance Reform

Presidential corruption is enabled by weak ethics laws. Support organizations pushing for structural reform:

**Key Legislation to Support:**

- **ETHICS Act** -- Would ban elected officials and their families from launching or promoting financial products (directly targets memecoin conflicts)
- **Presidential Tax Transparency Act** -- Would require presidential candidates to release tax returns
- **Foreign Emoluments Accountability Act** -- Would create enforcement mechanisms for the Emoluments Clause
- **STOCK Act Strengthening** -- Would close loopholes in congressional trading disclosure

**How to support:**
1. Call your representatives and ask them to co-sponsor these bills
2. Support organizations lobbying for passage ([Common Cause](https://www.commoncause.org/), [Public Citizen](https://www.citizen.org/))
3. Write letters to the editor of your local newspaper about the need for ethics reform

---

### Monitor and Document

**Track Trump Organization Activity**

You can independently monitor financial conflicts using public data:

- **[SEC EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch)** -- Search for Trump Media (DJT) filings, insider transactions, quarterly reports

**Submit FOIA Requests**

You can file Freedom of Information Act requests for government records about:

- Visitor logs at Trump properties during government business

**How to file a FOIA request:**
