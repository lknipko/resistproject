## Quick Actions

### Call About NATO and Alliance Commitments

**Why it matters:** Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is a binding U.S. obligation ratified by the Senate. Congressional pressure can prevent the administration from unilaterally abandoning alliance commitments.

**Call Script:**
> "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY/ZIP]. I'm calling to urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to defend U.S. commitments to NATO and our treaty allies. Article 5 is a binding obligation ratified by the Senate, not a suggestion. Threatening to abandon allies who have fought alongside us -- including after 9/11 -- undermines our national security. I urge [NAME] to publicly affirm Article 5 and oppose any reduction in U.S. commitment to NATO. Thank you."

**Who to call:**
- **Senate Foreign Relations Committee members** are the most critical targets
- Find your Senators: [Senate.gov](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm)
- Find your Representative: [House.gov](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)
- **Senate switchboard:** 202-224-3121
- **House switchboard:** 202-225-3121

### Call About Ukraine Support

**Why it matters:** Ukraine is fighting to defend its sovereignty against Russian invasion. Pausing military aid and demanding mineral rights as payment undermines both Ukraine and the principle that borders cannot be changed by force.

**Call Script:**
> "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY/ZIP]. I'm calling about U.S. support for Ukraine. I urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to support continued military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine without exploitative conditions like the minerals deal. Abandoning Ukraine rewards Russian aggression and tells every U.S. ally that our commitments can be bought and sold. Please support legislation to maintain Ukraine aid and oppose any deal that extracts resources from a nation we should be helping. Thank you."

**Key targets:**
- Members of the **Senate Foreign Relations Committee**
- Members of the **House Foreign Affairs Committee**
- Members of the **Senate and House Armed Services Committees**
- Members of the **Senate and House Appropriations Committees** (they control aid funding)

### Call About Territorial Threats

**Why it matters:** Threatening to annex Greenland, seize the Panama Canal, or absorb Canada violates the UN Charter and destroys U.S. credibility as a defender of international law -- the very law we invoke when condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

**Call Script:**
> "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY/ZIP]. I'm calling because I'm deeply concerned about the President's threats to annex Greenland, seize the Panama Canal, and absorb Canada. These threats violate the UN Charter, undermine our treaty obligations, and make the U.S. look like the kind of aggressive power we claim to oppose. I urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to publicly condemn territorial threats against sovereign allies and reaffirm that the U.S. respects international law. Thank you."

### Call About Venezuela and Cuba

**Why it matters:** Invoking a wartime statute from 1798 against Venezuelans, revoking TPS protections, and threatening to blockade Cuba have humanitarian consequences and questionable legal authority.

**Call Script:**
> "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY/ZIP]. I'm calling about U.S. policy toward Venezuela and Cuba. I urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to oppose the use of the Alien Enemies Act against Venezuelans -- the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela, and this law was designed for wartime. I also oppose the threatened naval blockade of Cuba, which constitutes an act of war under international law. Please support humanitarian approaches rather than military escalation in Latin America. Thank you."

### Email the Foreign Affairs Committees

These are the congressional committees with primary jurisdiction over foreign policy. Contacting committee members -- even if they are not your representatives -- signals public attention.

**Senate Foreign Relations Committee:**
- **Chair:** Contact via [Senate Foreign Relations Committee](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/)
- **Key Members to Contact:**
  - Your own Senators (most impactful)
  - Committee Chair and Ranking Member
  - Any Senator from your state on the committee

**House Foreign Affairs Committee:**
- **Chair:** Contact via [House Foreign Affairs Committee](https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/)
- **Key Members to Contact:**
  - Your own Representative (most impactful)
  - Committee Chair and Ranking Member

**Email Template - NATO and Ukraine:**

```
Subject: Uphold U.S. Treaty Obligations to NATO and Ukraine

Dear [Senator/Representative] [Last Name],

I am writing as your constituent from [City, State, ZIP] to urge you to
take action to defend U.S. alliance commitments.

Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is a binding obligation ratified
by the U.S. Senate. NATO allies invoked it for the first and only time
after 9/11, sending troops to fight alongside Americans in Afghanistan.
Conditioning this commitment on spending targets has no basis in the
treaty and destroys the credibility that deters aggression.

I urge you to:
1. Publicly affirm U.S. commitment to Article 5
2. Support continued military aid to Ukraine without exploitative conditions
3. Oppose any reduction in U.S. force presence in Europe
4. Hold hearings on the administration's foreign policy toward allies

Our alliances are not protection rackets. They are the foundation of
American security and global stability.

Thank you for your attention to this critical matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[Your Phone]
```

**Email Template - Territorial Threats:**

```
Subject: Oppose Threats Against Sovereign Allies - Greenland, Panama, Canada

Dear [Senator/Representative] [Last Name],

I am writing as your constituent from [City, State, ZIP] regarding the
President's threats to annex Greenland, seize the Panama Canal, and
absorb Canada.

These statements violate the UN Charter (Article 2, Section 4), which
prohibits "the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity
or political independence of any state." They also undermine the
Torrijos-Carter Treaties ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1978.

The United States built the rules-based international order. When we
threaten to violate it, we lose the moral authority to condemn others
who do the same -- including Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

I urge you to:
1. Publicly condemn territorial threats against sovereign nations
2. Reaffirm the binding nature of U.S. treaty obligations
3. Hold oversight hearings on the administration's territorial rhetoric
4. Pass a resolution affirming respect for allied sovereignty

Thank you.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
```

**Email Template - Venezuela and Cuba:**

```
Subject: Oppose Military Escalation in Latin America

Dear [Senator/Representative] [Last Name],

I am writing as your constituent from [City, State, ZIP] regarding U.S.
policy toward Venezuela and Cuba.

The invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 against Venezuelans
raises serious constitutional concerns. This wartime statute was last
used for Japanese internment -- the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela.
Federal courts have already blocked implementation.

Additionally, threatening a naval blockade of Cuba constitutes an act of
war under international law. The humanitarian crisis in Cuba is being
worsened, not helped, by tightened sanctions and blockade threats.

I urge you to:
1. Oppose the use of the Alien Enemies Act outside of wartime
2. Protect TPS designations for Venezuelans fleeing crisis
3. Oppose any naval blockade of Cuba
4. Support humanitarian rather than military approaches to Latin America

Thank you.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
```

### Engage with Allied Embassies

Show solidarity with allied nations under pressure. Embassies track U.S. public sentiment and report it to their governments.

**Key Embassies in Washington, D.C.:**

| Embassy | Address | Phone |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Denmark** | 3200 Whitehaven St NW | (202) 234-4300 |
| **Panama** | 2862 McGill Terrace NW | (202) 483-1407 |
| **Canada** | 501 Pennsylvania Ave NW | (202) 682-1740 |
| **Ukraine** | 3350 M St NW | (202) 349-2963 |
| **EU Delegation** | 2175 K St NW | (202) 862-9500 |

**What to do:**
- Write letters of solidarity to allied embassies
- Attend embassy public events and cultural programs
- Follow allied government social media and amplify their statements
- Contact your own state's trade representatives about alliance relationships

### Attend Events and Rallies

**Stand with Ukraine events:**
- [Razom for Ukraine - Events](https://www.razomforukraine.org/)
- Local Ukrainian community organizations often host solidarity events
- Check Ukrainian churches and cultural centers in your area

**Foreign policy forums:**
- [Atlantic Council Events](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/events/) - Many are free and open to the public
- [CSIS Events](https://www.csis.org/events) - Public policy discussions
- [Council on Foreign Relations - Public Events](https://www.cfr.org/events)

**Congressional town halls:**
- Ask your representatives about their position on NATO, Ukraine, and territorial threats
- Attend armed services committee hearings when possible (open to public)
- Use [Town Hall Project](https://townhallproject.com/) to find events near you

### Write Op-Eds and Letters to the Editor

Foreign policy issues get less constituent attention than domestic issues. This means your voice carries more weight.

**Key points for op-eds:**

1. **NATO is not a protection racket** -- Article 5 is a binding treaty obligation. NATO allies fought alongside the U.S. after 9/11.
2. **Threatening allies violates our own principles** -- The U.S. condemns Russia for violating territorial sovereignty. We cannot do the same.
3. **Abandoning Ukraine emboldens aggressors** -- China, Russia, and others watch how we treat our commitments.
4. **The minerals deal is exploitative** -- Demanding resources from a nation under invasion is not partnership, it is extraction.
5. **Local impact** -- Many communities have military bases, defense industry jobs, or diaspora populations directly affected by these policies.

**Tips:**
- Keep letters under 200 words
- Reference a specific recent event
- Mention your local connection (military family, allied trade partner, etc.)
- Submit to your local newspaper -- representatives track local media
