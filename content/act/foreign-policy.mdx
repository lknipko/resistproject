## Quick Summary

## Quick Actions

### Email Your Representatives

<EmailTemplate repType="all">
  <EmailMessage topic="NATO & Ukraine Support" subject="Uphold U.S. Treaty Obligations to NATO and Ukraine" body={`Dear {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to urge you to take action to defend U.S. alliance commitments.

Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is a binding obligation ratified by the U.S. Senate. NATO allies invoked it for the first and only time after 9/11, sending troops to fight alongside Americans in Afghanistan. Conditioning this commitment on spending targets has no basis in the treaty and destroys the credibility that deters aggression.

I urge you to:
1. Publicly affirm U.S. commitment to Article 5
2. Support continued military aid to Ukraine without exploitative conditions
3. Oppose any reduction in U.S. force presence in Europe
4. Hold hearings on the administration's foreign policy toward allies

Our alliances are not protection rackets. They are the foundation of American security and global stability.

Thank you for your attention to this critical matter.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`} />
  <EmailMessage topic="Territorial Sovereignty" subject="Oppose Threats Against Sovereign Allies" body={`Dear {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} regarding the President's threats to annex Greenland, seize the Panama Canal, and absorb Canada.

These statements violate the UN Charter (Article 2, Section 4), which prohibits "the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state." They also undermine the Torrijos-Carter Treaties ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1978.

The United States built the rules-based international order. When we threaten to violate it, we lose the moral authority to condemn others who do the same -- including Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

I urge you to:
1. Publicly condemn territorial threats against sovereign nations
2. Reaffirm the binding nature of U.S. treaty obligations
3. Hold oversight hearings on the administration's territorial rhetoric
4. Pass a resolution affirming respect for allied sovereignty

Thank you.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`} />
  <EmailMessage topic="Latin America Policy" subject="Oppose Military Escalation in Latin America" body={`Dear {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} regarding U.S. policy toward Venezuela and Cuba.

The invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 against Venezuelans raises serious constitutional concerns. This wartime statute was last used for Japanese internment -- the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela. Federal courts have already blocked implementation.

Additionally, threatening a naval blockade of Cuba constitutes an act of war under international law. The humanitarian crisis in Cuba is being worsened, not helped, by tightened sanctions and blockade threats.

I urge you to:
1. Oppose the use of the Alien Enemies Act outside of wartime
2. Protect TPS designations for Venezuelans fleeing crisis
3. Oppose any naval blockade of Cuba
4. Support humanitarian rather than military approaches to Latin America

Thank you.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`} />

### Call Your Representatives

Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is a binding U.S. obligation ratified by the Senate. Congressional pressure can prevent the administration from unilaterally abandoning alliance commitments.

<CallRepButton repType="all">
  <CallScript topic="NATO Commitments" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge {repName} to defend U.S. commitments to NATO and our treaty allies. Article 5 is a binding obligation ratified by the Senate, not a suggestion. Threatening to abandon allies who have fought alongside us -- including after 9/11 -- undermines our national security.

I urge {repName} to publicly affirm Article 5 and oppose any reduction in U.S. commitment to NATO. Thank you.`} />
  <CallScript topic="Ukraine Aid" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling about U.S. support for Ukraine. I urge {repName} to support continued military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine without exploitative conditions like the minerals deal. Abandoning Ukraine rewards Russian aggression and tells every U.S. ally that our commitments can be bought and sold.

Please support legislation to maintain Ukraine aid and oppose any deal that extracts resources from a nation we should be helping. Thank you.`} />
  <CallScript topic="Territorial Threats" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling because I'm deeply concerned about the President's threats to annex Greenland, seize the Panama Canal, and absorb Canada. These threats violate the UN Charter, undermine our treaty obligations, and make the U.S. look like the kind of aggressive power we claim to oppose.

I urge {repName} to publicly condemn territorial threats against sovereign allies and reaffirm that the U.S. respects international law. Thank you.`} />
  <CallScript topic="Latin America Policy" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling about U.S. policy toward Venezuela and Cuba. I urge {repName} to oppose the use of the Alien Enemies Act against Venezuelans -- the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela, and this law was designed for wartime.

I also oppose the threatened naval blockade of Cuba, which constitutes an act of war under international law. Please support humanitarian approaches rather than military escalation in Latin America. Thank you.`} />

Show solidarity with allied nations under pressure. Embassies track U.S. public sentiment and report it to their governments.

| Embassy | Address | Phone |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Denmark** | 3200 Whitehaven St NW | (202) 234-4300 |
| **Panama** | 2862 McGill Terrace NW | (202) 483-1407 |
| **Canada** | 501 Pennsylvania Ave NW | (202) 682-1740 |
| **Ukraine** | 3350 M St NW | (202) 349-2963 |
| **EU Delegation** | 2175 K St NW | (202) 862-9500 |

**What to do:**
- Write letters of solidarity to allied embassies
- Attend embassy public events and cultural programs
- Follow allied government social media and amplify their statements
- Contact your own state's trade representatives about alliance relationships

### Attend Events and Rallies

**Stand with Ukraine events:**
- [Razom for Ukraine - Events](https://www.razomforukraine.org/)
- Local Ukrainian community organizations often host solidarity events
- Check Ukrainian churches and cultural centers in your area

**Foreign policy forums:**
- [Atlantic Council Events](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/events/) - Many are free and open to the public
- [CSIS Events](https://www.csis.org/events) - Public policy discussions
- [Council on Foreign Relations - Public Events](https://www.cfr.org/events)

**Congressional town halls:**
- Ask your representatives about their position on NATO, Ukraine, and territorial threats
- Attend armed services committee hearings when possible (open to public)
- Use [Town Hall Project](https://townhallproject.com/) to find events near you

### Write Op-Eds and Letters to the Editor

Foreign policy issues get less constituent attention than domestic issues. This means your voice carries more weight.

**Key points for op-eds:**

1. **NATO is not a protection racket** -- Article 5 is a binding treaty obligation. NATO allies fought alongside the U.S. after 9/11.
2. **Threatening allies violates our own principles** -- The U.S. condemns Russia for violating territorial sovereignty. We cannot do the same.
3. **Abandoning Ukraine emboldens aggressors** -- China, Russia, and others watch how we treat our commitments.
4. **The minerals deal is exploitative** -- Demanding resources from a nation under invasion is not partnership, it is extraction.
5. **Local impact** -- Many communities have military bases, defense industry jobs, or diaspora populations directly affected by these policies.

**Tips:**
- Keep letters under 200 words
- Reference a specific recent event
- Mention your local connection (military family, allied trade partner, etc.)
- Submit to your local newspaper -- representatives track local media
