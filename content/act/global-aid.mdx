# Support Global Humanitarian Aid

## Quick Summary

The dismantling of USAID and the freeze on foreign aid has put millions of lives at immediate risk. Over 20 million people face interruption of lifesaving HIV treatment, tens of millions face food insecurity, and maternal health programs serving millions of women have been halted. You can take action right now: call Congress to demand restoration of appropriated funds, donate directly to organizations stepping in where USAID left off, and support legal challenges to the aid freeze. Every action matters -- these are real people whose lives depend on whether the world responds.

## Quick Actions

### Call Your Representatives

Congressional offices tally every call by issue. High call volume on foreign aid signals constituent priority and is harder to ignore than emails. Members of the Appropriations and Foreign Relations/Affairs committees have the most direct power to act.

<CallRepButton repType="all" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge {repName} to demand the restoration of USAID and the release of congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds. The administration is illegally withholding billions that Congress directed be spent on programs that save millions of lives, including PEPFAR, which provides HIV treatment to over 20 million people.

Withholding these funds violates the Impoundment Control Act. I urge {repName} to use every tool available -- including hearings, legislation, and the power of the purse -- to restore these lifesaving programs. Thank you.`} />

### Email Your Representatives

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Restore USAID and Release Appropriated Foreign Aid Funds"
  repType="all"
  body={`Dear {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to demand the restoration of USAID operations and the immediate release of congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds.

The administration's freeze on foreign assistance is:

1. Potentially illegal under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 -- Congress appropriated these funds and the president cannot unilaterally refuse to spend them
2. Putting 20+ million people on PEPFAR HIV treatment at risk of death from treatment interruption
3. Removing the world's largest emergency food donor during active famines
4. Destroying 60+ years of institutional expertise that cannot be rebuilt

PEPFAR, created by President George W. Bush with bipartisan support, has saved 25 million lives. Ending it is not a partisan issue -- it is a humanitarian catastrophe.

I urge you to:
- Hold hearings on the legality of the aid freeze
- Introduce or support legislation requiring release of appropriated foreign aid funds
- Investigate DOGE access to sensitive USAID systems
- Use every tool at your disposal to restore these programs

Lives are at stake every day this continues. Please act now.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}

### Advocate for PEPFAR Restoration

PEPFAR was created by a Republican president (George W. Bush) and has had bipartisan support for over 20 years. Use this history to make the case to representatives across the political spectrum.

**Key Talking Points:**

1. **PEPFAR saved 25 million lives** -- it is the most successful global health initiative in history
2. **Bipartisan legacy** -- Created by Bush, expanded by Obama, maintained by Trump (first term), continued by Biden
3. **National security** -- Stable, healthy populations are less likely to generate conflict, terrorism, or mass migration
4. **Cost-effective** -- PEPFAR costs ~$7 billion/year; the U.S. defense budget is ~$886 billion/year. Development aid prevents far more expensive military interventions
5. **Constitutional issue** -- Congress appropriated these funds. Withholding them may violate the Impoundment Control Act
6. **American jobs** -- Thousands of American employees and contractors depend on USAID programs

**Organize a Constituent Meeting:**
- Request a meeting with your representative's staff (district office)
- Bring 3-5 constituents who care about global health
- Share personal stories about why PEPFAR matters
- Bring printed materials (fact sheets from [ONE Campaign](https://www.one.org/) or [KFF](https://www.kff.org/))
- Follow up with a thank-you note and continue relationship

> USAID was the world's largest provider of emergency food assistance. It has been gutted. Right now, tens of millions of people in famine zones have lost their primary food source. This is not about politics. This is about people dying. Donate to @WFP today.
