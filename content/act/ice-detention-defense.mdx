## Quick Actions

### Call Your Representatives NOW

ICE is operating with record funding, near-zero oversight, and rescinded protections for schools, churches, and hospitals. Your representatives need to hear from you.

> "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY/ZIP]. I'm calling to urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to take immediate action on ICE accountability. DHS rescinded protections for schools, churches, and hospitals. A legal U.S. resident was wrongfully deported to a foreign prison. Two U.S. citizens were killed by federal agents in Minneapolis. I demand: mandatory body cameras for ICE agents, restoration of sensitive location protections, independent investigation of deaths in custody, and full funding for immigration courts to clear the backlog. Thank you."

**Call the Senate Switchboard: [202-224-3121](tel:202-224-3121)**

**Find Your Representatives:**
- [Senate.gov Contact Directory](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm) — Find your senators
- [House.gov Find Your Representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) — Find your House member
- [5 Calls](https://5calls.org/) — Guided calling with issue-specific scripts
- Text RESIST to **50409** to connect with [Resistbot](https://resist.bot/) — sends letters to all your representatives at once

### [+] Email Templates

**Template 1: ICE Accountability and Oversight**

```
Subject: Demand ICE Accountability — Body Cameras, Oversight, Sensitive Location Protections

Dear [Senator/Representative NAME],

I am writing as your constituent to demand immediate action on Immigration and Customs Enforcement accountability.

Since January 2025:
- DHS rescinded protections for schools, churches, and hospitals
- Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a legal U.S. resident, was wrongfully deported to El Salvador's CECOT prison
- Two U.S. citizens were killed by federal agents in Minneapolis
- Multiple people have died in ICE custody
- The House passed $64.4 billion for DHS without a single oversight amendment

I urge you to:
1. Require mandatory body cameras for all ICE enforcement operations
2. Restore and codify sensitive location protections
3. Mandate independent investigations of all deaths in ICE custody
4. Fund immigration courts to ensure due process
5. Demand Bivens reform so families can sue agents for constitutional violations

The rule of law requires accountability. Funding without oversight enables abuse.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
```

**Template 2: Sensitive Location Protections**

```
Subject: Restore Protections for Schools, Churches, and Hospitals from ICE Enforcement

Dear [Senator/Representative NAME],

I am writing to urge you to codify sensitive location protections that were rescinded on January 20, 2025.

Schools are reporting enrollment drops. Hospitals are seeing fewer patients. Domestic violence victims are refusing to seek protective orders. Crime witnesses are not appearing in court. This policy change is making ALL of us less safe.

Please co-sponsor or introduce legislation to:
- Prohibit ICE enforcement at or near schools, hospitals, churches, and courthouses
- Require judicial warrants (not administrative warrants) for enforcement at any sensitive location
- Create penalties for violations of sensitive location protections

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
```

**Send via Resistbot:** Text RESIST to **50409**, then follow prompts to send to all your representatives at once.

### [+] Report ICE Activity Safely

**If You Witness ICE Enforcement:**

1. **Stay calm and observe from a safe distance** — You have a First Amendment right to observe and record law enforcement in public spaces
2. **Do NOT physically interfere** — This can result in arrest
3. **Record if safe to do so** — Video from a safe distance; note time, location, number of agents, vehicle descriptions, badge numbers if visible
4. **Report to these organizations:**

| Organization | How to Report | What They Do |

| [United We Dream](https://unitedwedream.org/) | Call **1-844-363-1423** | Deportation defense hotline |
| [Freedom for Immigrants](https://www.freedomforimmigrants.org/) | Call **209-757-3733** | Detention reporting and advocacy |

### [+] Know Your Rights

**If ICE Comes to Your Door:**

1. **You do NOT have to open the door.** ICE cannot enter without a judicial warrant signed by a judge (NOT an ICE administrative warrant signed by an ICE agent).
2. **Ask to see the warrant.** Have them slide it under the door. A judicial warrant will say "United States District Court" at the top.
3. **You have the right to remain silent.** You do not have to answer questions about your immigration status, where you were born, or how you entered the country.
4. **Do not sign anything** without speaking to a lawyer.
5. **Say: "I do not consent to your entry. I am exercising my right to remain silent. I want to speak to a lawyer."**

**If You Are Detained:**

1. **Do not sign anything** — especially a voluntary departure form — without a lawyer
2. **You have the right to a phone call.** Call a family member or attorney immediately.
3. **You have the right to an attorney** (though the government does not provide one in immigration proceedings)
4. **Memorize an emergency contact number** in case your phone is taken

**Post 2 (Abrego Garcia Case):**

> Two U.S. citizens killed by federal agents in Minneapolis. $64.4B for DHS with zero oversight amendments. Call your senators at 202-224-3121 and demand: body cameras, use-of-force reporting, independent investigations, sensitive location protections. #ICEAccountability #DHS

**Post 4 (Know Your Rights):**

### [+] Support Detainees Directly

People in ICE detention are often isolated, frightened, and without resources. Here is how you can help directly:

**Write Letters:**
- [Freedom for Immigrants Pen Pal Program](https://www.freedomforimmigrants.org/pen-pal-program) — Be matched with a detained person to exchange letters
- [Immigrant Families Together](https://www.immigrantfamiliestogether.com/) — Letter writing and support

**Commissary Funds:**
- Detained individuals must pay for basic necessities (soap, phone calls, snacks) from commissary accounts
- [Freedom for Immigrants](https://www.freedomforimmigrants.org/) coordinates commissary fund contributions
- Contact your local immigration detention facility to ask about contributing to a specific detainee's account

**Bond Funds:**
- Immigration bond can be $1,500 to $25,000+ — most detained people cannot afford it
- Contributing to bond funds directly gets people out of detention
- [National Bond Fund](https://www.freedomforimmigrants.org/bond-fund)
- [RAICES Bond Fund](https://www.raicestexas.org/bond-fund/)

**Visitation Programs:**
- [Freedom for Immigrants Community Visitation Program](https://www.freedomforimmigrants.org/community-visitation-program) — Visit detained individuals at ICE facilities
- Provide emotional support, monitor conditions, and report abuses
- Training provided; no legal experience required

### [+] Become a Legal Observer

Legal observers attend ICE enforcement operations and court proceedings to document what happens and deter abuses.

**How to Get Trained:**
- [National Lawyers Guild](https://www.nlg.org/) — Offers legal observer training nationwide
- [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/) — Check your local ACLU chapter for training dates
- Many local rapid response networks offer their own training

**What Legal Observers Do:**
- Attend immigration court hearings to monitor due process
- Observe ICE enforcement operations from public spaces
- Document agents' actions, badge numbers, and tactics
- Report findings to legal organizations and media
- Serve as witnesses in legal proceedings if needed

**Court Watch Programs:**
- [American Immigration Lawyers Association Court Watch](https://www.aila.org/) — Monitor immigration court proceedings
- [National Immigrant Justice Center](https://immigrantjustice.org/) — Court monitoring programs

### [+] Support Sanctuary Policies

Sanctuary policies limit local law enforcement cooperation with ICE, protecting community trust and public safety.

**What You Can Do:**
- Research whether your city, county, or state has a sanctuary policy
- If it does: attend city council meetings to support maintaining it against federal pressure
- If it does not: advocate with your local elected officials to adopt one

**Model Sanctuary Policies:**
- [ILRC — Understanding Sanctuary Cities](https://www.ilrc.org/understanding-sanctuary-cities) — Comprehensive guide to what sanctuary means
- [Center for American Progress — Sanctuary Policy Overview](https://www.americanprogress.org/) — Research on public safety benefits

**Key Argument:** Sanctuary policies make communities safer. When immigrants trust local police, they report crimes, cooperate as witnesses, and participate in community safety. When local police act as immigration enforcers, entire communities stop cooperating.
