## Why This Matters

**Constitutional Crisis:**
- Due process guaranteed to ALL persons on U.S. soil
- ICE operating with near-zero oversight
- Wrongful detention of U.S. citizens violates 4th Amendment

**Humanitarian Crisis:**
- Families separated indefinitely
- Children in detention
- Deaths in custody with no accountability

**Public Safety:**
- Sensitive location policies kept schools/hospitals safe
- Fear of deportation prevents crime reporting
- Community trust in law enforcement destroyed

**Your Voice Matters:**
- Congressional oversight is the primary check on executive agencies
- High call volume from constituents influences votes
- Local organizing has stopped raids and won policy changes

## Updated Actions: February 2026

### Operation Metro Surge Ended — But the Fight Continues

Operation Metro Surge ended officially on February 12, 2026 — in part because of sustained pressure from advocates, community members, and congressional leaders. **This is a win. And the work continues.**

Nationwide enforcement operations remain active. The structural conditions that enabled Metro Surge (unlimited funding, no oversight, sensitive location rescission) are still in place.

### Support the ACLU's First Amendment Lawsuit

The ACLU filed a class action against DHS in February 2026 over the arrest and detention of journalists, legal observers, and protesters in Minneapolis. You can help:

- **Donate:** [ACLU — Fund the Minneapolis First Amendment Case](https://www.aclu.org/donate)
- **Amplify:** Share the lawsuit on social media; tag your House Judiciary representatives
- **Volunteer as a legal observer:** Contact National Lawyers Guild ([nlg.org](https://www.nlg.org)) for observer training in your area

### Demand Congressional Accountability on the 14% Statistic

The Congressional testimony (February 2026) revealed fewer than 14% of ICE arrests under Metro Surge had violent criminal records. Use this in your advocacy:

<EmailTemplate repType="all">
  <EmailMessage topic="ICE Accountability" subject="Demand Accountability: Less Than 14% of Surge Arrests Were Violent Offenders" body={`Dear {repName},

The recent House Judiciary Committee testimony revealed that fewer than 14% of ICE arrests under Operation Metro Surge involved individuals with violent criminal records. Meanwhile, 475,000+ total removals in Trump's first year have separated families and traumatized communities.

I urge you to:
1. Hold hearings on ICE's arrest practices and the disproportionate targeting of non-violent individuals
2. Support legislation requiring ICE to publicly report the criminal history breakdown of all arrests
3. Demand reinstatement of sensitive location protections for schools, churches, and hospitals
4. Support oversight amendments to any future DHS appropriations bills

The Constitution's due process guarantee applies to all persons on U.S. soil. The current enforcement approach is not making us safer — it is destroying community trust and targeting people who pose no public safety threat.
