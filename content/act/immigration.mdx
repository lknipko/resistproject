## Quick Actions

### Email Your Representatives

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Protect due process rights for all immigrants"
  repType="senator"
  body={`Dear Senator {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to express deep concern about immigration enforcement actions that bypass established legal procedures.

The Constitution guarantees due process to all persons within U.S. borders, not just citizens. Current mass deportation policies threaten these fundamental protections.

I urge you to:
- Oppose funding for enforcement that circumvents immigration courts
- Support legislation requiring judicial review before deportation
- Conduct oversight of ICE and CBP enforcement practices
- Restore protections for schools, churches, and hospitals

The rule of law must apply equally to all.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}
