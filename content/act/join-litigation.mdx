# Join Litigation

## Quick Summary

After Trump v. CASA ended universal injunctions, your participation in lawsuits became essential. If a federal policy harms you, joining a lawsuit may be the only way to receive legal protection. The government can continue enforcing policies against everyone who isn't a party to a case.

## Quick Actions

### Understand Why This Matters

**Before *Trump v. CASA* (June 2025):**
- One lawsuit could block a policy nationwide
- Courts issued "universal injunctions" protecting everyone

**After *Trump v. CASA*:**
- Courts can only protect people who are parties to the lawsuit
- The government can continue enforcing policies against everyone else
- If you're not in a lawsuit, you may not be protected

**This means:** If a federal policy harms you, joining a lawsuit may be the only way to receive legal protection.

### Check If You're Affected

You may be a potential plaintiff if:

| Issue | Who's Affected |
|-------|----------------|
| **Birthright citizenship (EO 14160)** | Parents whose U.S.-born children are being denied passports or SSNs |
| **Medicaid cuts (OBBBA)** | People losing coverage due to reverification or state cuts |
| **Vaccine access** | People denied pharmacy vaccination in restricted states |
| **Schedule F retaliation** | Federal employees terminated after reclassification |
| **ICE enforcement** | People harmed by immigration enforcement actions |

### Connect with Legal Organizations

**If you've been directly harmed by federal policy:**

| Organization | Focus Area | Contact |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/) | Civil liberties | Find your state affiliate |
| [National Immigration Law Center](https://www.nilc.org/) | Immigration | nilc.org/get-help |
| [Lambda Legal](https://www.lambdalegal.org/) | LGBTQ+ rights | lambdalegal.org/helpdesk |
| [NAACP Legal Defense Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/) | Racial justice | naacpldf.org |
| [Earthjustice](https://earthjustice.org/) | Environmental | earthjustice.org |
| [Public Citizen](https://www.citizen.org/) | Consumer rights | citizen.org |

## How Class Actions Work

### What is a Class Action?

A class action allows many people with similar claims to sue together. One or more "named plaintiffs" represent the entire "class" of affected people.

**Benefits:**
- Efficiency - one case instead of thousands
- Resources - legal organizations fund the litigation
- Strength in numbers - courts take large classes seriously

### How to Join a Class Action

1. **Determine if you qualify** - Check the class definition
2. **Contact the legal team** - Organizations recruiting plaintiffs list contact info
3. **Provide documentation** - Evidence of how you were harmed
4. **Sign retainer/participation agreement** - Authorizing lawyers to represent you

### What Class Members Do

**As a named plaintiff:**
- Provide testimony/declarations
- May be deposed (questioned by opposing lawyers)
- Your name may become public
- May need to appear in court

**As an unnamed class member:**
- Benefit from any court order
- Usually no active participation required
- May receive notice of settlement

---

## Sustained Actions

### Become a Named Plaintiff

Named plaintiffs are essential to post-*CASA* litigation. If you've been harmed:

**What to expect:**
- Legal team will interview you about your experience
- You'll provide documents and declarations
- You may be deposed (questioned under oath)
- Your name may appear in court filings
- The process can take months or years

**Protections:**
- Attorneys can request protective orders for sensitive information
- Some cases allow pseudonymous plaintiffs (e.g., "Jane Doe")
- Retaliation for participating in litigation is illegal

### Help Recruit Plaintiffs

Legal teams need affected people in every federal judicial district.

**How to help:**
- Share information about active cases in your community
- Connect affected individuals with legal organizations
- Translate materials for non-English speakers
- Accompany people to legal intake appointments

### Support Litigation Financially

Public interest law organizations accept donations:

- [ACLU Foundation](https://www.aclu.org/)
- [NAACP Legal Defense Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/)
- [Earthjustice](https://earthjustice.org/)
- [Public Justice](https://www.publicjustice.net/)

## Your State Attorney General

### Why AGs Matter

After *Trump v. CASA*, State Attorneys General may have broader standing to seek relief for state residents than individual plaintiffs.

**Check if your AG has filed suit:**
- [State AG Directory](https://www.naag.org/attorneys-general/the-attorneys-general/)
- Search "[Your State] Attorney General lawsuit [issue]"

### Pressure Your AG

If your AG hasn't joined litigation:

> "I urge Attorney General [NAME] to join litigation challenging [POLICY]. After *Trump v. CASA*, state AGs are among the few actors who can seek broad relief for state residents. [STATE] residents deserve the protection that comes from our state joining these cases."
