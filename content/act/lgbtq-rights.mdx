## Quick Actions

### Email Your Representatives

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Oppose Anti-LGBTQ+ Executive Orders and Support the Equality Act"
  repType="all"
  body={`Dear {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to express my strong opposition to the administration's anti-LGBTQ+ executive orders and to urge you to support the Equality Act.

Executive Orders 14168, 14173, 14175, and 14187 collectively redefine sex to erase transgender identity from federal recognition, ban transgender military service, dismantle workplace protections, and threaten schools with funding cuts for including transgender students. These orders harm an estimated 1.6 million transgender Americans, 15,000 transgender service members, and millions of LGBTQ+ students and federal employees.

The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Skrmetti has made federal statutory protection more urgent than ever. Without the Equality Act, LGBTQ+ Americans face a patchwork of state laws where their fundamental rights depend on their zip code.

I urge you to:
1. Co-sponsor the Equality Act (H.R. 15 / S. 5)
2. Oppose any appropriations riders that codify anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination
3. Support oversight of executive order implementation affecting LGBTQ+ communities
4. Oppose the "Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act"

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}
/>

### Call Your Representatives

Congressional offices track call volume by issue. High volume on LGBTQ+ rights signals constituent priority and influences votes on the Equality Act and anti-discrimination appropriations riders.

<CallRepButton repType="all">
  <CallScript topic="Oppose Executive Orders" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge {repName} to oppose the administration's anti-LGBTQ+ executive orders, including EO 14168 which redefines sex to erase transgender recognition, EO 14175 which bans transgender military service, and EO 14187 which strips funding from schools with transgender athletes.

These orders harm millions of Americans and violate the equal protection principles of our Constitution. I urge {repName} to co-sponsor the Equality Act and oppose any legislation that codifies discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. Thank you.`} />
  <CallScript topic="Support Equality Act" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge {repName} to co-sponsor and vote for the Equality Act, which would add sexual orientation and gender identity to federal civil rights protections.

After the Supreme Court's Skrmetti decision, federal statutory protection is essential. Thank you.`} />

The Trump administration has issued 4 executive orders targeting LGBTQ+ Americans. EO 14168 erases transgender identity from federal recognition. The Equality Act would protect ALL Americans from discrimination.

## Know Your Rights

### Protections That Still Exist

Despite the executive orders, some legal protections remain:

**Federal:**
- ***Bostock v. Clayton County* (2020)** - Title VII still prohibits employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. If you are fired, demoted, or harassed at work because you are LGBTQ+, you can file a complaint with the EEOC. [EEOC Filing](https://www.eeoc.gov/filing-charge-discrimination)
- **Marriage equality** - *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015) remains the law. Same-sex marriages are legally recognized nationwide. The Respect for Marriage Act (2022) provides additional statutory protections.
- **Fair Housing Act** - HUD previously interpreted sex discrimination to include sexual orientation and gender identity. While enforcement has weakened, the statute itself still applies per *Bostock* reasoning.

**State-Level:**
- **24 states + DC** have laws explicitly prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, and public accommodations
- **Sanctuary states** (CA, CO, CT, IL, MD, MA, MN, NJ, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA) have shield laws protecting gender-affirming care

**If You Experience Discrimination:**
1. **Document everything** - Save emails, texts, records of incidents with dates and witnesses
2. **File a complaint** - [EEOC](https://www.eeoc.gov/) (employment), [HUD](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/online-complaint) (housing), your state civil rights agency
3. **Contact legal help** - [Lambda Legal Help Desk](https://www.lambdalegal.org/helpdesk): 1-866-542-8336
