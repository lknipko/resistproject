# Pharmacy Access & Vaccine Advocacy

## Quick Actions

### Check Your State's Status

After HHS removed six vaccines from "routine" recommendations, states split into two categories:

**States That Decoupled (Pharmacy Access Maintained):**
- New York (Executive Order 52.5)
- California
- [Check your state below]

**States Following Federal Guidance (Pharmacy Access Restricted):**
- Pharmacists may need physician prescription to administer affected vaccines
- [Check your state below]

### Find Vaccine Access Near You

**If you need a vaccine:**

1. **Community Health Centers** - [FindAHealthCenter.hrsa.gov](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/)
   - Serve everyone regardless of insurance
   - Sliding scale fees

2. **Local Health Departments** - [NACCHO Directory](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory)
   - Often provide vaccines at low or no cost

3. **Pharmacies** (in decoupled states) - [Vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/)

### Know What Changed

**Vaccines removed from "Routine" to "Shared Clinical Decision-Making":**
1. COVID-19
2. Influenza (Flu)
3. Hepatitis A
4. Hepatitis B
5. Two additional childhood vaccines

**What "SCDM" means:**
- No longer automatically recommended for all
- Requires individual consultation with provider
- May trigger pharmacy practice law restrictions in some states

## Sustained Actions

### Advocate for State Decoupling

If your state follows federal guidance:

**Contact your Governor:**
- Request executive order decoupling state pharmacy law from federal recommendations
- Use New York EO 52.5 as a model

**Contact your State Legislature:**
- Support bills that allow pharmacists to administer all FDA-approved vaccines
- Testify at health committee hearings

**Contact your State Pharmacy Board:**
- Boards can issue guidance clarifying pharmacist authority
- Public comment periods allow citizen input

### Sample Advocacy Script

> "I'm calling to urge [Governor/Legislator] to decouple [STATE]'s pharmacy practice laws from federal vaccine recommendations. The HHS decision to remove vaccines from the 'routine' list has restricted access in our state. New York has shown this can be fixed with [executive order/legislation]. I urge you to act to protect public health access for [STATE] residents."

### Support Public Health Organizations

Organizations working on vaccine access:

| Organization | Focus | How to Help |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| [Vaccinate Your Family](https://www.vaccinateyourfamily.org/) | Vaccine advocacy | Donate, volunteer |
| [AAP - American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.aap.org/) | Child health | Support state chapters |
| [APHA - American Public Health Association](https://www.apha.org/) | Public health policy | Membership, advocacy |

## If You Can't Access a Vaccine

### Alternative Access Points

1. **Your Primary Care Physician** - Can still prescribe and administer
2. **Community Health Centers** - [FindAHealthCenter.hrsa.gov](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/)
3. **Local Health Departments** - [NACCHO Directory](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory)
4. **Hospital Outpatient Clinics** - Check with local hospitals
5. **Travel Clinics** - For Hepatitis vaccines especially

### Insurance Coverage Questions

The ACA requires insurers to cover "recommended" preventive care without cost-sharing. The SCDM reclassification creates ambiguity:

**If your insurer denies coverage:**
1. Request written denial with specific reason
2. File an internal appeal
3. If denied again, file external appeal with your state insurance commissioner
4. Contact [Healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/) for guidance
