# Defend Press Freedom

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Protect the First Amendment's guarantee of press freedom by supporting organizations that defend journalists, subscribing to independent media, contacting Congress about press freedom legislation, and directly opposing government censorship. A free press is the foundation of democratic accountability -- without it, government operates without oversight.

## Quick Actions

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Support the PRESS Act to protect press freedom"
  repType="senator"
  body={`Dear Senator {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to urge you to co-sponsor and vote for the PRESS Act.

This legislation would create a federal reporter's privilege, protecting journalists from being forced to reveal confidential sources. A free press is essential to democracy, and reporters need legal protection to do their jobs without fear of government retaliation.

Recent attacks on press freedom—including revoking credentials from the Associated Press, filing multi-billion-dollar lawsuits against news organizations, and threatening broadcast licenses—demonstrate the urgent need for legislative protections.

I urge you to:
- Co-sponsor the PRESS Act
- Support federal anti-SLAPP legislation
- Publicly defend press freedom against government attacks

Thank you for protecting the First Amendment.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}

### Subscribe to Independent Journalism

**Why it matters:** News organizations survive on subscriptions and donations. Every subscription is a vote for independent journalism. When you pay for news, you reduce outlets' dependence on advertising revenue that can be weaponized by government pressure campaigns.

|--------|-------|-----------|
| **ProPublica** | Investigative journalism, nonprofit | [propublica.org/donate](https://www.propublica.org/donate) |

---

### Share and Amplify

**Why it matters:** Sharing quality journalism increases its reach and signals that independent reporting has an audience. This counteracts the administration's strategy of delegitimizing critical coverage.

**What to share:**
- Share stories from credentialed journalists covering government activities
- Amplify reporting from outlets that have had credentials revoked
- Share reports from press freedom organizations (CPJ, RCFP, RSF)
- Highlight specific instances of press freedom violations with context

**How to share effectively:**
- Add your own context about why the story matters
- Tag your representatives and ask for their position
- Use hashtags that connect to broader press freedom conversations
- Share across multiple platforms to reach different audiences

**Social media template:**

```
Press freedom is under attack. [Outlet] has been [specific action: sued/had credentials revoked/etc.] for doing their job: reporting the news.

The First Amendment protects the press. I stand with journalists.

[Link to story or press freedom report]

@[YourSenator] @[YourRep] - Where do you stand on press freedom?
```

## Sustained Actions

### Support Press Freedom Organizations

These organizations directly defend journalists, provide legal representation, track press freedom violations, and advocate for structural protections.

**Legal Defense & Advocacy:**

| Organization | Mission | How to Support |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **[Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP)](https://www.rcfp.org/)** | Free legal help for journalists; First Amendment advocacy; anti-SLAPP litigation | [Donate](https://www.rcfp.org/donate/) |
| **[Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)](https://cpj.org/)** | Tracks journalist safety worldwide; emergency assistance for journalists in danger | [Donate](https://cpj.org/donate/) |
| **[Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/)** | Digital security tools for journalists; SecureDrop platform for whistleblowers | [Donate](https://freedom.press/donate/) |
| **[PEN America](https://pen.org/)** | Free expression advocacy; tracks censorship and press freedom threats | [Donate](https://pen.org/donate/) |
| **[Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ)](https://www.spj.org/)** | Journalism ethics; First Amendment advocacy; legal defense fund | [Join/Donate](https://www.spj.org/join.asp) |

### Become a Sustaining Member of Independent Media

A sustaining (monthly) membership provides predictable revenue that allows newsrooms to invest in long-term investigations rather than chasing clicks.

**Recommended monthly memberships:**

- **$5/month** to your local newspaper or public radio station
- **$10/month** to a national investigative outlet (ProPublica, The Marshall Project, The Intercept)
- **$15/month** to a press freedom organization (RCFP, CPJ, Freedom of the Press Foundation)

**Why monthly matters:** Recurring revenue is more valuable than one-time donations because it allows newsrooms to plan and hire for sustained coverage. A $10/month sustaining membership is more impactful than a single $120 annual donation because of the predictability it provides.

---

### Contribute to Journalist Legal Defense

When journalists are sued, arrested, or subpoenaed, legal defense funds are critical. Without financial support, many journalists -- especially freelancers and those at small outlets -- cannot afford to fight.

**Legal Defense Funds:**

- **[RCFP Legal Defense Fund](https://www.rcfp.org/donate/)** - Provides free legal representation to journalists
- **[CPJ Journalist Assistance Program](https://cpj.org/campaigns/assistance/)** - Emergency grants for journalists in danger
- **[SPJ Legal Defense Fund](https://www.spj.org/ldf.asp)** - Supports journalists facing legal threats
- **[PEN America Writers at Risk Program](https://pen.org/writers-at-risk/)** - Assistance for writers and journalists under threat
- **[Rory Peck Trust](https://rorypecktrust.org/)** - Support for freelance journalists in dangerous situations

**When specific cases arise:** Watch for individual legal defense campaigns when journalists are arrested or sued. Organizations like RCFP and CPJ typically coordinate fundraising and legal representation.

### Use FOIA to Support Transparency

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) gives every citizen the right to request government records. You do not need to be a journalist to file a FOIA request. Filing FOIA requests supports transparency and can uncover information about government activities that the press can then report on.

**How to file a FOIA request:**

1. **Identify the agency** that has the records you want
2. **Write your request** describing the records as specifically as possible
3. **Submit via the agency's FOIA portal** or by mail
4. **Track your request** and appeal if denied

**FOIA request tools:**

- [FOIA.gov](https://www.foia.gov/) - Central FOIA portal for all federal agencies
- [MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/) - Free tool that files, tracks, and publishes FOIA requests
- [FOIA Machine](https://foiamachine.org/) - Automated FOIA filing tool from RCFP
- [FOIA Project](https://foiaproject.org/) - Tracks federal FOIA litigation

**Effective FOIA strategies:**

- Be as specific as possible about dates, names, and document types
- File with multiple agencies if the topic crosses jurisdictional lines
- Request fee waivers (available for requests serving the public interest)
- If denied, appeal -- many denials are overturned on appeal
- Share results with journalists who can provide context and analysis

---

### Attend Events and Organize

**Press Freedom Events:**

- **World Press Freedom Day** (May 3) - Attend or organize local events
- **Sunshine Week** (March, annually) - Celebrate open government and press freedom
- **First Amendment rallies** - Watch for events organized by RCFP, SPJ, and local press clubs
- **Town halls** - Ask your representatives about their position on press freedom at town hall events

**Start a Local Press Freedom Committee:**

1. Connect with your local press club or SPJ chapter
2. Organize letter-writing campaigns to elected officials
3. Host screenings of press freedom documentaries
4. Invite local journalists to speak about press freedom challenges
5. Monitor local press freedom incidents and report them to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker

2. **Use Signal with disappearing messages** for sensitive conversations
3. **Use SecureDrop** for submitting documents to major news organizations
4. **Access SecureDrop via Tor Browser** for additional anonymity
5. **Consult a lawyer** before disclosing classified or sensitive information
6. **See our [Whistleblower Resources](/act/whistleblower) page** for comprehensive guidance
