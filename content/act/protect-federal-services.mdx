# Protect Federal Services

## Quick Summary

DOGE has fired over 260,000 federal employees and is dismantling agencies that millions of Americans depend on -- Social Security, VA healthcare, food safety, weather forecasting, and consumer protection. Congress has the power to stop this. Your calls, your pressure, and your support for legal challenges are the most effective tools available right now.

## Quick Actions

### Call Your Representatives NOW

**Phone calls are the single most effective form of constituent pressure.** Congressional staff tally calls and report volume to members. High call volume on an issue directly influences votes.

**Find your representatives:**
- [House.gov - Find Your Representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)
- [Senate.gov - Find Your Senators](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm)
- **Fastest:** Text your zip code to [Resistbot](https://resist.bot/) at **50409**

**Congressional Switchboard:**
- **House:** 202-225-3121
- **Senate:** 202-224-3121

**Pro Tips:**
- Call in the morning (9-10 AM Eastern) for shortest wait times
- Call the DC office for policy issues
- Be brief: state your name, zip code, and specific ask
- Ask to be "logged on the issue"
- Call both senators AND your House representative -- that's 3 calls
- If you get voicemail, leave a message -- they still count those

### Send a Letter in 2 Minutes

**Resistbot** makes it effortless:
1. Text **RESIST** to **50409**
2. Follow the prompts
3. Your letter goes to all your representatives

**5 Calls** provides issue-specific scripts:

**Email template (copy/paste):**

```
Subject: Demand Congressional Oversight of DOGE - [YOUR CITY]

Dear [Senator/Representative NAME],

I am writing as your constituent from [CITY, ZIP] to demand
immediate congressional oversight of the Department of Government
Efficiency (DOGE).

DOGE has fired over 260,000 federal employees, accessed sensitive
Treasury and personnel systems without proper clearances, and moved
to shut down agencies created by Congress -- including the CFPB and
USAID. Multiple federal courts have found these actions likely
illegal.

I specifically urge you to:

1. Hold hearings on DOGE's legal authority and operations
2. Investigate Elon Musk's conflicts of interest ($15B+ in
   federal contracts)
3. Support legislation to restore fired federal workers
4. Enforce the Impoundment Control Act to prevent cancellation
   of congressionally appropriated funds

[PERSONAL IMPACT: Add 1-2 sentences about how DOGE cuts affect
you -- Social Security for a parent, VA care for a veteran family
member, food safety concerns, etc.]

The Constitution gives Congress -- not unelected billionaires --
the power to create, fund, and close federal agencies.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
```

---

### Share on Social Media

Copy and share these facts:

> DOGE has fired 260,000+ federal workers. Social Security disability claims now take 12+ months. VA hospitals are understaffed. Food safety inspections cut 25-30%. This isn't efficiency -- it's demolition. Call Congress: 202-224-3121

> Elon Musk has $15+ billion in government contracts through SpaceX, Tesla, and other companies. DOGE is cutting the agencies that regulate those contracts. This is the definition of corruption. Demand oversight: 202-225-3121

> Courts have ruled DOGE's actions likely illegal -- violations of the Privacy Act, the APA, and separation of powers. The administration has defied court orders. This is a constitutional crisis. Contact your representatives today.

---

## Issue-Specific Call Scripts

Use these scripts when calling your representatives. Pick the issue closest to your personal experience -- personal stories are the most effective.

### [+] Social Security

> "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY/ZIP]. I'm calling about the devastating impact of DOGE cuts on the Social Security Administration. SSA has lost thousands of employees since January. Disability claims that used to take 6 months now take over a year. Field offices are closing. Phone wait times have doubled.
>
> [If applicable: My parent/grandparent/I depend on Social Security for basic living expenses. OR: I know someone waiting months for a disability determination.]
>
> I urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to:
> 1. Support full funding for SSA staffing
> 2. Hold hearings on DOGE's impact on Social Security services
> 3. Oppose any further SSA workforce reductions
>
> Thank you for your time. Please log me on this issue."

**Key facts to reference:**
- SSA disability claims backlog exceeds 1 million
- Field offices closed or reduced hours nationwide
- Phone wait times increased to 2+ hours
- 70 million Americans receive Social Security benefits

---

### [+] Veterans Affairs

> "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY/ZIP]. I'm calling about DOGE cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Over 1,700 VA employees have been fired, causing staffing shortages at VA hospitals, longer wait times for mental health services, and benefits processing backlogs.
>
> [If applicable: I am a veteran / my family member is a veteran who relies on VA healthcare. OR: I believe we have a sacred obligation to care for those who served.]
>
> I urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to:
> 1. Support full VA staffing levels
> 2. Investigate DOGE's impact on veteran care
> 3. Ensure the Veterans Crisis Line and mental health services are fully resourced
>
> Thank you. Please log me on this issue."

**Key facts to reference:**
- 1,700+ VA employees fired
- Benefits claims processing backlogs grew 30%+
- Mental health wait times increased
- Rural VA clinics face closures

---

### [+] Food & Aviation Safety

> "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY/ZIP]. I'm calling about the impact of DOGE cuts on food safety and aviation safety.
>
> FDA food safety inspections have been cut by 25-30%. The FAA already had a 30-year low in air traffic controllers before DOGE made it worse. NTSB has called for immediate staffing restoration after multiple near-miss incidents.
>
> [If applicable: I fly regularly / I have young children and am concerned about food safety. OR: Everyone eats food and many of us fly -- these cuts affect all Americans.]
>
> I urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to:
> 1. Oppose any further cuts to FDA, USDA, or FAA
> 2. Support emergency funding for air traffic controller staffing
> 3. Hold hearings on food safety inspection reductions
>
> Thank you. Please log me on this issue."

**Key facts to reference:**
- FDA food inspections cut 25-30%
- FAA air traffic controllers at 30-year low
- NTSB called for immediate FAA staffing restoration
- 800+ FDA employees fired

---

### [+] Consumer Protection (CFPB)

> "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY/ZIP]. I'm calling about the shutdown of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. DOGE ordered the CFPB to 'stand down,' halting all enforcement against financial fraud, predatory lending, and illegal junk fees.
>
> The CFPB has returned $17.5 billion to consumers since it was created. Only Congress has the authority to close an agency it created. A federal court has already blocked this shutdown.
>
> [If applicable: I have personally dealt with credit card issues / predatory lending / debt collection abuse that the CFPB addresses.]
>
> I urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to:
> 1. Defend the CFPB's existence and funding
> 2. Support legislation preventing executive shutdown of congressionally created agencies
> 3. Investigate why the administration tried to close a consumer protection agency
>
> Thank you. Please log me on this issue."

**Key facts to reference:**
- CFPB has returned $17.5 billion to consumers
- A federal court blocked the shutdown
- Only Congress can close an agency it created
- Credit card late fee cap was among rules halted

---

### [+] DOGE Oversight & Conflicts of Interest

> "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY/ZIP]. I'm calling to demand congressional oversight of DOGE and Elon Musk's massive conflicts of interest.
>
> Musk's companies hold over $15 billion in federal contracts while DOGE cuts the agencies that regulate them. SpaceX holds NASA and DoD contracts while DOGE cuts FAA and NASA. Tesla is under NHTSA safety investigation while DOGE cuts NHTSA. This violates federal ethics law -- 18 U.S.C. Section 208.
>
> I urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to:
> 1. Hold hearings on Musk's conflicts of interest
> 2. Subpoena DOGE records and communications
> 3. Investigate whether DOGE actions benefited Musk's companies
> 4. Support the Federal Advisory Committee Act requirements for DOGE transparency
>
> Thank you. Please log me on this issue."

**Key facts to reference:**
- $15+ billion in Musk company federal contracts
- SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, X all subject to federal oversight
- 18 U.S.C. Section 208 prohibits conflicts of interest
- FACA requires advisory committees to operate transparently

---

### [+] Student Loans & Education

> "Hello, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY/ZIP]. I'm calling about DOGE's gutting of the Department of Education. Half the department's employees have been fired. Civil rights investigations have stopped. Title IX enforcement has halted. Student loan servicing is in chaos.
>
> [If applicable: I have federal student loans / my child receives special education services / I rely on Pell Grants.]
>
> I urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to:
> 1. Oppose the closure of the Department of Education
> 2. Ensure student loan borrowers continue to be served
> 3. Support continued civil rights enforcement in schools
> 4. Protect IDEA special education funding
>
> Thank you. Please log me on this issue."

**Key facts to reference:**
- $1.6 trillion in federal student loans for 43 million borrowers
- $14 billion annually for special education (IDEA)
- 6.6 million low-income students receive Pell Grants
- Civil rights and Title IX enforcement halted

---

### [+] File FOIA Requests

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a powerful tool for forcing transparency. You do not need to be a journalist or lawyer to file a FOIA request.

**What to Request**

Effective FOIA requests related to DOGE:
- DOGE team rosters and security clearance status at specific agencies
- Communications between DOGE staff and agency leadership
- Records of DOGE access to Treasury payment systems
- Data extraction logs from OPM personnel databases
- Cost-benefit analyses for proposed DOGE cuts
- Communications about CFPB or USAID shutdown decisions

**How to File**

1. **Identify the agency** that holds the records you want
2. **Write a specific request** -- narrow requests get faster responses
3. **Submit through the agency's FOIA portal** -- every agency has one:
   - [FOIA.gov - Submit Requests](https://www.foia.gov/)
   - Find any agency's FOIA office at [FOIA.gov](https://www.foia.gov/)
4. **Track your request** -- agencies must respond within 20 business days
5. **Appeal denials** -- you have the right to appeal; many denials are overturned

**Template FOIA Request:**

```
Dear FOIA Officer,

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552,
I request access to and copies of:

[SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF RECORDS]

covering the period from January 20, 2025 to the present.

I am willing to pay fees up to $25.00. If estimated fees exceed
this amount, please contact me before proceeding.

If any portion of this request is denied, please cite the specific
exemption(s) and notify me of my right to appeal.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.

[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[Your Email]
```

**Organizations Filing FOIA for You**

If you do not want to file yourself, these organizations are actively filing FOIA requests about DOGE:
- [American Oversight](https://www.americanoversight.org/) -- Files hundreds of FOIA requests; publishes results
- [Democracy Forward](https://democracyforward.org/) -- FOIA litigation
- [MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/) -- Helps anyone file FOIA requests for free

---

### [+] Attend Town Halls

**Why Town Halls Matter**

In-person events are the highest-impact form of constituent pressure. Representatives remember faces and stories. Local media covers town halls, amplifying your message.

**Find Town Halls:**
- [Town Hall Project](https://townhallproject.com/) -- National database of upcoming events
- Check your representatives' websites for scheduled events
- Follow your reps on social media for event announcements

**At the Town Hall:**

1. **Arrive early** -- Get a seat near the front or microphone
2. **Prepare one clear question** -- Focus on a single DOGE issue
3. **Tell a personal story** -- How does the service cut affect you or your community?
4. **Be respectful but firm** -- Demand a specific answer, not vague reassurances
5. **Record the response** -- Share on social media to hold them accountable
6. **Follow up** -- Call their office the next week referencing the town hall

**Sample Town Hall Question:**

> "[Representative NAME], DOGE has fired over 260,000 federal employees. Social Security disability claims now take over a year. VA hospitals are understaffed. What specific actions are you taking to restore funding and staffing to these agencies? Will you commit to holding oversight hearings on DOGE?"

---

### [+] Track and Report DOGE Impacts

If you experience or witness the impact of DOGE cuts on federal services, document and report it:

**How to Document**

1. **Keep a log** -- Date, agency, issue, wait time, outcome
2. **Take screenshots** -- Error messages, closed-office notices, wait time screens
3. **Save correspondence** -- Letters about benefit delays, service changes
4. **Note staff comments** -- If federal workers mention staffing shortages, document it (with permission)

**Where to Report**

- **Your representative's office** -- Personal constituent stories are the most powerful advocacy tool
- **Your state attorney general** -- If your state is part of anti-DOGE litigation, they want impact evidence
- **Inspector General hotlines** -- Report waste, fraud, or abuse: [CIGIE IG list](https://www.ignet.gov/)
- **Government Accountability Project** -- If you witness government wrongdoing: [whistleblower.org](https://whistleblower.org/)
- **Local media** -- Journalists covering DOGE impacts want real stories from real people
