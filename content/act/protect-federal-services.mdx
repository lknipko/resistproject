## Email Your Representatives

### Email Your Senators - DOGE Oversight

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Demand congressional oversight of DOGE"
  repType="senator"
  body={`Dear Senator {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to urge immediate congressional oversight of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

DOGE has:
- Fired over 260,000 federal employees with no due process
- Accessed Treasury systems controlling $6.8 trillion in annual payments
- Operated with zero transparency or congressional approval
- Created conflicts of interest (Elon Musk has $15 billion in government contracts)

The Constitution grants Congress the power to determine executive branch structure and spending. DOGE is bypassing this authority entirely.

I urge you to:
- Support congressional hearings on DOGE operations
- Demand GAO audits of all DOGE actions and contracts
- Restore congressional oversight of federal workforce decisions
- Investigate conflicts of interest

Thank you for defending constitutional governance.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}

### Email Your Representative - Federal Services

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Protect federal services and restore oversight"

I am writing from {zipCode} about the dismantling of federal services through DOGE.

Federal services critical to my community are being eliminated without congressional approval:
- Social Security processing delays
- Veterans' benefits disruptions
- Food safety inspections
- Weather forecasting
- Scientific research

Congress has the constitutional authority over federal spending and agency structure.

I urge you to:
- Demand hearings on DOGE operations
- Restore congressional oversight
- Protect essential federal services
- Investigate Elon Musk's conflicts of interest

Thank you,
{firstName} {lastName}`}
