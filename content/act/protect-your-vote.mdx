## Quick Actions

<div className="bg-orange/10 border-2 border-orange p-6 my-8">

### CHECK YOUR VOTER REGISTRATION NOW

**This is the single most important action on this page.** With aggressive voter roll purges happening across the country, your registration may have been removed without your knowledge.

**Check your registration right now:**

- **[Vote.org - Verify Your Registration](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/)** -- Takes 30 seconds. Enter your name, date of birth, and state.
- **[USA.gov - Check Your Voter Registration](https://vote.gov/)** -- Official federal resource linking to every state's registration system.
- **[Can I Vote (NASS)](https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote)** -- National Association of Secretaries of State official portal.

**Find your state's direct registration lookup:**
Every state has its own Secretary of State website with voter registration lookup. Search "[Your State] voter registration lookup" or use the links above.

**If you are NOT registered or your registration has been removed:**
- **[Vote.org - Register to Vote](https://www.vote.org/register-to-vote/)** -- Online registration available in 40+ states
- **[Register at your local DMV](https://www.usa.gov/motor-voter)** -- Under the National Voter Registration Act, you can register when getting or renewing your driver's license
- **In-person registration** -- Visit your county election office

**Check your registration regularly.** With purges happening on rolling schedules, check at least every 3 months and always 30+ days before any election.

### Call Your Representatives

Congressional offices tally calls by issue. High call volume on voting rights signals constituent priority and influences votes on the SAVE Act and other voting legislation.

<CallRepButton repType="all">
  <CallScript topic="Oppose the SAVE Act" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge {repName} to oppose the SAVE Act and any legislation that imposes proof-of-citizenship requirements for voter registration. An estimated 21 million eligible American citizens lack readily accessible documentary proof of citizenship. This bill would prevent more eligible voters from registering than any noncitizen it could possibly catch.

Noncitizen voting is already a federal crime. I urge {repName} to protect every citizen's right to vote. Thank you.`} />
  <CallScript topic="Support John Lewis VRA" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge {repName} to co-sponsor and support the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Since the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder, states have closed over 1,600 polling places and enacted dozens of new voting restrictions.

We need federal oversight restored. Thank you.`} />
  <CallScript topic="Oppose Voter Roll Purges" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling about mass voter roll purges. These purges have removed eligible citizens from the rolls without proper notice or due process.

I urge {repName} to support oversight of state purge programs and fully fund the Election Assistance Commission. Thank you.`} />
</CallRepButton>

### Email Your Representatives

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Protect Voting Rights"
  repType="all"
  body={`Dear {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to express my deep concern about the ongoing attacks on voting rights in our country.

Mass voter roll purges have removed eligible citizens from registration rolls without adequate notice. The SAVE Act would require documentary proof of citizenship that an estimated 21 million Americans lack. Federal election security funding has been frozen. The DOJ Voting Rights Division has been gutted.

I urge you to:

1. Oppose the SAVE Act and any proof-of-citizenship voting requirements
2. Support the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act
3. Fully fund the Election Assistance Commission and CISA election security programs
4. Demand oversight of state voter roll purge programs

The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy. I am watching how you vote on these issues and will remember at the ballot box.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}

## Know Your Rights at the Polls

<div className="bg-teal/10 border-l-4 border-teal p-6 my-8">

**Election Protection Hotline: 866-OUR-VOTE (866-687-8683)**

Save this number in your phone. If you experience ANY problems voting, call immediately. Trained legal volunteers can help you resolve issues in real time.

**Additional language hotlines:**
- **Spanish:** 888-VE-Y-VOTA (888-839-8682)

- **Arabic:** 844-YALLA-US (844-925-5287)

</div>

### If Your Name Is Not on the Rolls

**You have the right to cast a provisional ballot.** Under the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), every state must provide provisional ballots to voters whose eligibility is in question.

**Steps:**
1. **Ask for a provisional ballot.** Poll workers are legally required to provide one.
2. **Fill it out completely.** Your vote will be counted if your eligibility is confirmed.
3. **Get the receipt.** You will receive a tracking number to check whether your ballot was counted.
4. **Follow up.** Contact your county election office within the timeframe specified (varies by state, typically 7-10 days) to verify your ballot was counted.
5. **Call 866-OUR-VOTE** if poll workers refuse to give you a provisional ballot.

**Important:** A provisional ballot is your federal right. No poll worker can deny you one.

### If Someone Challenges Your Right to Vote

In some states, private citizens or partisan poll watchers can challenge your eligibility at the polls. If this happens:

**Your rights:**
- **You do NOT have to prove citizenship at the polls** (unless your state specifically requires voter ID -- check your state's requirements)
- **You have the right to cast a provisional ballot** regardless of any challenge
- **Poll watchers cannot speak to you, touch you, or block your access** to the polling place
- **Voter intimidation is a federal crime** under 18 U.S.C. Section 594 and 52 U.S.C. Section 20511

**What to do:**
1. Stay calm and do not leave the polling place
2. Ask to speak to the chief election judge or poll manager
3. Request a provisional ballot if your regular ballot is denied
4. Call **866-OUR-VOTE** immediately
5. Document what happened (who challenged you, what they said, any witnesses)

---

### If the Polls Close While You're in Line

**If you are in line when the polls close, you have the right to vote.** Do not leave the line. This is protected by law in every state.

**What to do:**
- **Stay in line.** The polling place must remain open until every person in line has voted.
- **If anyone tells you to leave,** call 866-OUR-VOTE immediately.
- **Document the time you joined the line** (take a photo or note the time).

---

### If Your Polling Place Has Changed or Moved

- **Check your polling place before Election Day:** [Vote.org - Polling Place Locator](https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/)
- If your polling place has been moved or closed, you can still vote at the location you are sent to
- Ask for directions to your correct polling place
- If you go to the wrong location, ask for a provisional ballot or directions to the right place
- Call 866-OUR-VOTE if you cannot find your polling place or if it has been closed without notice

---

### Voter ID Requirements by State

Voter ID requirements vary significantly by state. Before Election Day:

- **[Vote.org - Voter ID Requirements](https://www.vote.org/voter-id-laws/)** -- Check your state's specific requirements
- **[NCSL - Voter ID Laws](https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id)** -- Comprehensive state-by-state comparison
- **If you lack required ID:** Many states offer free voter ID cards. Contact your county election office or call 866-OUR-VOTE for help obtaining one.

### Become a Poll Worker

**Why it matters:** Experienced, nonpartisan poll workers ensure elections run smoothly. With mass resignations of election workers due to threats and harassment, there is a critical shortage nationwide.

**How to sign up:**
- **[Power the Polls](https://www.powerthepolls.org/)** -- National poll worker recruitment organization. Enter your information and they connect you with your local election office.
- **[WorkElections.org](https://workelections.org/)** -- Find specific openings in your jurisdiction.
- **Contact your county election office directly** -- Search "[Your County] election office poll worker" for direct applications.

**What to expect:**
- **Training:** Typically 2-4 hours, provided by your county
- **Pay:** Most jurisdictions pay poll workers $100-300 per day
- **Time commitment:** Election Day is a long day (typically 6 AM to 9 PM), plus setup and takedown
- **Requirements:** Must be a registered voter in most states; some states allow 16-17 year olds

**Why poll workers matter now:** Poll workers are the first defense against election irregularities. A trained, vigilant poll worker can:
- Ensure every voter receives the correct ballot
- Prevent voter intimidation
- Guarantee provisional ballots are offered when required
- Accurately count ballots
- Document any problems for legal follow-up

---

### Volunteer for Voter Registration Drives

**Why it matters:** With new restrictions on third-party voter registration in states like Florida and Texas, organized registration drives are more important than ever.

**How to get involved:**

- **[League of Women Voters](https://www.lwv.org/local-leagues)** -- Find your local league and join their registration drives
- **[HeadCount](https://www.headcount.org/)** -- Register voters at concerts and events (youth-focused)
- **[Voto Latino](https://vfreg.votolatino.org/)** -- Latino voter registration drives
- **[Campus Vote Project](https://www.campusvoteproject.org/)** -- Student voter registration on college campuses
- **[When We All Vote](https://whenweallvote.org/)** -- Community-based voter registration campaigns

**Best practices for registration drives:**
1. Know your state's registration deadlines
2. Carry printed registration forms (not everyone has online access)
3. Know which IDs or documents are needed in your state
4. Help people check existing registrations (they may already be registered)
5. Follow up with people you register -- remind them of election dates

**Critical:** If your state has penalties for late submission of registration forms (like Florida), ensure you understand the rules completely before organizing a drive. Contact the League of Women Voters or your local election office for guidance.

### Election Observer Training

**What election observers do:** Trained, credentialed observers monitor polling places and ballot counting facilities to ensure compliance with election law. They serve as a deterrent against irregularities and document problems for legal challenges.

**How to become an observer:**

- **[Common Cause](https://www.commoncause.org/)** -- Trains election monitors in many states
- **[Election Protection Coalition](https://866ourvote.org/)** -- Trains legal volunteers for Election Day hotline and polling place monitoring
- **Your state or county party** -- Both major parties train and credential poll watchers
- **Nonpartisan organizations** -- Many states allow nonpartisan observer organizations

**What observers can and cannot do:**
- CAN observe all steps of the voting and counting process from a designated area
- CAN document irregularities and report them
- CAN be present during ballot counting
- CANNOT speak to voters or interfere with voting
- CANNOT touch ballots or voting equipment
- CANNOT challenge voters (in most states this is restricted to designated challengers)
