# Protect Public Health

## Quick Summary

Public health infrastructure is being dismantled at every level: WHO withdrawal, CDC interference, NIH funding cuts, FDA weakening, and pandemic preparedness gutted. These changes affect everyone. You can fight back by contacting Congress, supporting science advocacy organizations, strengthening state-level public health, and ensuring your family stays protected.

## Quick Actions

### Call Your Representatives

<CallRepButton repType="all">
  <CallScript topic="WHO Withdrawal" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge {repName} to oppose U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization. The WHO is our early warning system for pandemics and coordinates disease surveillance across 194 countries. Withdrawal leaves Americans blind to emerging threats.

I urge {repName} to co-sponsor legislation requiring congressional approval for WHO withdrawal and to restore U.S. funding for global health security. Thank you.`} />
  <CallScript topic="NIH Funding Cuts" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling about the proposed 40% cut to NIH funding. NIH-funded research generates $103 billion in economic activity across all 50 states and has led to treatments for cancer, Alzheimer's, and infectious diseases. These cuts threaten medical breakthroughs, cost jobs, and send our best researchers to other countries.

I urge {repName} to support full NIH funding restoration in the FY2026 budget. Thank you.`} />
</CallRepButton>

**Tip:** Find your state's NIH funding at [NIH RePORTER](https://reporter.nih.gov/) to personalize your call with local impact data.

### Email Your Representatives

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Protect Public Health Infrastructure"
  repType="all"
  body={`Dear {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to express grave concern about the systematic dismantling of America's public health infrastructure.

The combination of WHO withdrawal, proposed 40% NIH budget cuts, politicization of CDC scientific guidance, and mass firings at HHS agencies leaves our country dangerously unprepared for the next health emergency. COVID-19 killed over 1.2 million Americans when we had these systems in place. Without them, the consequences of the next pandemic will be far worse.

I urge you to:
1. Hold oversight hearings on HHS leadership decisions
2. Support full NIH funding restoration
3. Co-sponsor legislation requiring congressional approval for WHO withdrawal
4. Investigate political interference with CDC scientific recommendations

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}
/>

**Most Impactful Single Action:** Join the [Union of Concerned Scientists' Science Network](https://www.ucsusa.org/science-network). They coordinate targeted advocacy campaigns and connect you with other advocates in your area.

### Strengthen State-Level Public Health

With federal infrastructure being dismantled, states are the frontline defense. Advocate for your state to:

**1. Decouple from Federal Vaccine Guidance**
- Contact your governor and state legislators
- Use New York's Executive Order 52.5 as a model
- See [Pharmacy Access Guide](/act/pharmacy-access) for details

**2. Increase State Health Department Funding**
- Attend state budget hearings
- Advocate for increased state funding to replace lost federal grants
- Support state public health laboratory capacity

**3. Join or Create a Local Public Health Advisory Board**
- Many counties and municipalities have citizen advisory boards
- Contact your local health department: [NACCHO Directory](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory)
- Volunteer for community health initiatives

**State Advocacy Script:**

<CallScript>
"I'm calling to urge [Governor/State Legislator] to strengthen [STATE]'s public health infrastructure in response to federal cuts. Specifically, I urge you to: [1] Decouple state pharmacy laws from federal vaccine recommendations, [2] Increase state funding for the [STATE] Department of Health, and [3] Protect state-level disease surveillance and emergency preparedness programs. [STATE] cannot rely on a federal government that is dismantling public health protections."
</CallScript>

### Support Medical Research

**For everyone:**
- Donate to medical research organizations that fund independent science
- Participate in clinical trials: [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/)
- Advocate for NIH funding with your representatives

| Organization | Focus | Website |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/) | Cancer research | cancer.org |
| [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/) | Heart disease research | heart.org |
| [Alzheimer's Association](https://www.alz.org/) | Alzheimer's research | alz.org |
| [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/) | Pediatric disease research | stjude.org |
| [Howard Hughes Medical Institute](https://www.hhmi.org/) | Biomedical research | hhmi.org |

**For researchers and academics:**
- Contact your institution's government relations office about coordinated advocacy
- Join the [Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB)](https://www.faseb.org/) advocacy network
- Attend congressional briefings on research funding
- Reach out to your representatives about the impact of NIH cuts on your institution

### Fight Health Misinformation

The same administration policies that dismantle infrastructure also flood the public with misinformation about vaccines, fluoride, and medical treatments. Counter this by:

**Personal actions:**
- Share evidence-based health information with your community
- When you see misinformation on social media, report it and share corrective information
- Discuss vaccination with hesitant family members and friends using empathy, not judgment

**Community actions:**
- Volunteer with local health literacy programs
- Support your public library's health information resources
- Attend school board meetings to support evidence-based health education

**Trusted Information Sources:**
- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) - Disease prevention and health data
- [WHO](https://www.who.int/) - Global health information
- [KFF](https://www.kff.org/) - Health policy analysis
- [HealthNewsReview](https://www.healthnewsreview.org/) - Evaluating health claims

### Talking Points

**On WHO Withdrawal:**
- The U.S. contributed $700M/year to WHO, roughly 15-18% of its budget
- WHO coordinates disease surveillance in 194 countries
- Without WHO membership, we lose early warning of emerging pandemics
- The previous withdrawal in 2020 was reversed in 2021

**On NIH Funding Cuts:**
- NIH funds 50,000 research grants at 2,500+ institutions in all 50 states
- NIH-funded research generates $103 billion in annual economic activity
- The proposed 40% cut would be the largest in NIH history
- Cuts threaten cancer, Alzheimer's, and infectious disease research

**On CDC Interference:**
- ACIP has set vaccine recommendations since 1964 based on science, not politics
- The January 2026 vaccine reclassification bypassed ACIP entirely
- Career scientists are being fired, taking decades of expertise with them
- Measles cases surged in 2025 as vaccination guidance was weakened

**On Pandemic Preparedness:**
- COVID-19 killed 1.2 million Americans with preparedness systems in place
- ASPR, BARDA, and Global Health Security programs are being gutted
- The U.S. is now less prepared than it was before COVID
- Climate change and global travel increase pandemic risk

### Sample Op-Ed Template

```
HEADLINE: [STATE] Needs Federal Public Health Protection, Not Dismantlement

As a resident of [CITY], I rely on the federal agencies now being
systematically weakened. The CDC tracks outbreaks that could reach
[STATE]. NIH funds research at [LOCAL INSTITUTION]. The FDA ensures
the safety of the food I buy and the medications I take.

The current administration is gutting all three. NIH faces a proposed
40% budget cut - the largest in its history. Career scientists at
CDC are being fired. The U.S. has withdrawn from the WHO, severing
our connection to global disease surveillance.

COVID-19 killed over 1.2 million Americans when we HAD these systems.
Without them, the next pandemic will be catastrophic.

Senator [NAME] must act: restore NIH funding, hold oversight hearings
on HHS leadership, and require congressional approval for WHO
withdrawal. Our health depends on it.

[Your name, city, credentials if relevant]
