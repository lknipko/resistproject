# School Board Advocacy

<TopSection>
  <QuickSummary highlight="School board elections often have low turnout - your involvement matters.">
    Local school boards make curriculum and policy decisions that directly affect students. After Mahmoud v. Taylor, parents can opt out of LGBTQ+ themes, but schools can still maintain inclusive materials and anti-bullying protections. Get involved to support teachers and students.

## Understanding the *Mahmoud v. Taylor* Decision

### What the Supreme Court Ruled

In *Mahmoud v. Taylor* (June 2025), the Court ruled that parents have a constitutional right to opt their elementary school children out of lessons involving LGBTQ+ themes based on religious objections.

**What this means for schools:**
- Individual parents can request opt-outs
- Schools must provide alternative instruction or excuse students
- This may require classroom logistics changes
- Does NOT require schools to remove inclusive materials entirely

### What Schools Can Still Do

- **Keep inclusive books in libraries** - Opt-outs apply to classroom instruction
- **Maintain anti-bullying policies** - Protection for all students
- **Provide inclusive curriculum** - For students whose parents don't opt out
- **Train teachers** - On handling diverse classrooms sensitively

## Sustained Actions

<SectionIntro>Ongoing opportunities for deeper engagement</SectionIntro>

### Run for School Board

- Filing paperwork by deadline
- Gathering signatures (sometimes)

**Resources:**
- [Run for Something](https://runforsomething.net/) - Training and support

### Support Inclusive Curriculum

**At school board meetings:**

- Counter opt-out requests with support for teachers' professional judgment
- Thank teachers and administrators who maintain inclusive classrooms

**Sample public comment:**

> "I'm [NAME], parent of a student at [SCHOOL]. I support our teachers' ability to use age-appropriate, inclusive materials that reflect the diversity of our community. All students deserve to see themselves in their education. I urge the board to continue supporting inclusive curriculum while respecting individual family choices."

## Digital Rights in Schools

### Age Verification Concerns

Following *Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton*, schools may face pressure to implement age verification for online content.

**What to watch for:**
- Proposals for student ID verification on devices
- Overly broad content filtering
- Monitoring software that tracks all student activity

**Questions to ask:**
- What data is collected?
- Who has access?
- How long is it retained?
- Can students opt out?

### Advocate for Student Privacy

- Support policies limiting surveillance software
- Oppose unnecessary data collection
- Ensure transparency about monitoring practices
- Protect student First Amendment rights

## If Your District Faces Challenges

### Book Bans or Curriculum Restrictions

1. **Attend the meeting** where the issue is discussed
2. **Sign up to speak** during public comment
3. **Bring supporters** - numbers matter
4. **Contact media** - local coverage increases pressure
5. **Document everything** - what books, what reasons given
