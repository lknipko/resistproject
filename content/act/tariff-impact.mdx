# Fight Back Against Harmful Tariffs

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Demand that Congress reclaim its constitutional authority over trade and oppose tariffs that function as a hidden tax on American families. The tariffs imposed since February 2025 cost the average household $2,100-$3,800 per year in higher prices. Congress has the power to end this -- but only if constituents demand it.

**Who pays tariffs?** American importers pay tariffs to U.S. Customs at the border. Not foreign countries. The cost is passed to you through higher prices on groceries, cars, electronics, clothing, and building materials.

**Congress can stop this.** Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress -- not the president -- the power to set tariffs. Multiple bills have been introduced to reclaim that authority.

## Quick Actions

### Email Your Representatives

<EmailTemplate
  subject="Constituent Request: Reclaim Congressional Tariff Authority"
  repType="all"
  body={`Dear {repName},

I am writing as your constituent from {zipCode} to urge you to support legislation reclaiming Congress's constitutional authority over tariffs.

The tariffs imposed since February 2025 through IEEPA emergency declarations are costing American families thousands of dollars annually in higher prices. The Congressional Budget Office estimates $2,100-$3,800 per household per year.

Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the exclusive power to "lay and collect... Duties." The use of IEEPA emergency powers for tariffs bypasses this authority. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled this use unconstitutional in April 2025.

I urge you to:
1. Co-sponsor the Trade Review Act or similar legislation requiring congressional approval for IEEPA tariffs
2. Support Senate Finance / House Ways and Means Committee oversight hearings on tariff impacts
3. Vote to terminate the tariff-related national emergency declarations

This is not a partisan issue -- it is a constitutional one. Congress must reclaim its authority.

Sincerely,
{firstName} {lastName}
{zipCode}`}
/>

### Call Your Representatives

Congressional offices tally constituent calls daily. High call volume on tariffs signals this is a voting issue. Staff report call topics directly to members.

<CallRepButton repType="all">
  <CallScript topic="Constitutional Authority" script={`Hello, my name is {firstName} {lastName} and I'm a constituent from {zipCode}.

I'm calling to urge {repName} to support legislation reclaiming Congress's constitutional authority over tariffs. The current tariffs imposed through IEEPA emergency powers are costing my family hundreds of dollars a month in higher prices on groceries, gas, and everyday goods.

The Constitution gives Congress -- not the president -- the power to set tariffs. I urge {repName} to co-sponsor the Trade Review Act or similar legislation requiring congressional approval for tariffs. Thank you.`} />
  <CallScript topic="Family Budget Impact" script={`Hi, I'm {firstName} {lastName} from {zipCode}.

I'm calling because tariffs are directly hurting my family. My grocery bill has gone up significantly on produce and everyday goods.

I urge {repName} to take action to reverse these tariffs or require congressional approval for future tariffs. This is a kitchen-table issue for my family. Thank you.`} />
</CallRepButton>

### Key Committees to Target

These committees have jurisdiction over trade policy. Calls to members on these committees carry extra weight:

**Senate Finance Committee** -- Primary jurisdiction over tariffs and trade
- [Committee Members List](https://www.finance.senate.gov/about/membership)
- Committee Phone: 202-224-4515

**House Ways and Means Committee** -- Primary jurisdiction over tariffs and trade
- [Committee Members List](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/about/membership/)
- Committee Phone: 202-225-3625

**If your Senator or Representative sits on either committee, your call is especially impactful.** Mention that you know they serve on the trade committee and that you expect them to exercise oversight.

### Share Your Tariff Story

Personal stories about tariff impacts are powerful advocacy tools. Share how tariffs have affected your:
- **Grocery bill** -- Higher prices on produce, meat, dairy, beer
- **Car purchase** -- $2,500-$12,000 higher vehicle prices
- **Small business** -- Higher costs for materials and inventory
- **Farm operation** -- Lost export markets from retaliatory tariffs
- **Home renovation** -- Higher lumber and building material costs

**Where to share:**
- Call your representative's office and tell them your story
- Write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper
- Post on social media with **#TariffTax** or **#WhoPaysTariffs**
- Submit your story to [Tariffs Hurt the Heartland](https://tariffshurt.com/) -- a coalition tracking tariff impacts

## Sustained Actions

### Support Trade Reform Legislation

Several bills have been introduced to reclaim congressional trade authority:

**Trade Review Act**
- Would require congressional approval for tariffs imposed under IEEPA
- Bipartisan support in both chambers
- Contact your representatives to urge co-sponsorship

**Reclaiming Congressional Trade Authority Act**
- Would terminate existing IEEPA tariff emergency declarations
- Would prohibit future use of IEEPA for tariffs without congressional authorization

**How to support:**
1. Call your representatives and ask them to co-sponsor these bills by name
2. Write letters to the editor supporting congressional trade authority
3. Attend town halls and raise trade authority as a constitutional issue
4. Track bill progress at [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/)

American farmers have been among the hardest hit by retaliatory tariffs. Ways to help:

- **Contact your state Farm Bureau** to learn about advocacy efforts: [fb.org](https://www.fb.org/)
- **Urge Congress** to provide meaningful relief beyond temporary aid packages

#### Small Businesses

Small businesses cannot absorb tariff costs the way large corporations can:
- **Shop local** at small businesses that are absorbing tariff costs to keep prices competitive
- **Support small business advocacy** through your local chamber of commerce
- **Share small business tariff stories** with your representatives

#### Workers in Affected Industries

Workers in agriculture, manufacturing, and retail face job losses from tariff impacts:
- **Support worker retraining programs** -- urge Congress to fund Trade Adjustment Assistance
- **Advocate for extended unemployment benefits** for tariff-displaced workers

### Attend Town Halls and Public Events

**Town halls are the single most effective way to pressure elected officials in person.** Tips:
1. Find your representative's town hall schedule at [Town Hall Project](https://townhallproject.com/)
2. Prepare a question about tariffs and congressional trade authority
3. Bring specific data: "$2,100-$3,800 per household" or "685,000 jobs at risk"
4. Be respectful but persistent -- elected officials remember constituents who show up
5. Record the response (with permission) and share on social media

### Write Op-Eds and Letters to the Editor

Your local newspaper reaches your representative's office. Template:

```
HEADLINE: Congress Must Reclaim Its Constitutional Authority Over Tariffs

The tariffs imposed since February 2025 are costing American families up to
$3,800 per year in higher prices. That's not a talking point -- it's the
Congressional Budget Office's own estimate.

[YOUR PERSONAL STORY: How tariffs have affected your family, business, or
community. Be specific about products and dollar amounts.]

Here's what many Americans don't realize: the president imposed these tariffs
by declaring trade deficits a "national emergency" under a law designed for
sanctioning hostile nations. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled this
unconstitutional. But the tariffs remain.

The Constitution is clear: Congress sets tariffs. [Senator/Representative NAME]
should support the Trade Review Act and vote to terminate these emergency
declarations. Our family budgets -- and our Constitution -- depend on it.

[Your name, city]
```
