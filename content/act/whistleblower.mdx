## Quick Actions

### Assess Your Situation

Before disclosing, understand:

1. **What type of wrongdoing?** Waste, fraud, abuse, violation of law, threat to public safety
2. **What evidence do you have?** Documents, emails, firsthand observation
3. **Who needs to know?** Inspector General, Congress, media, all of the above

### Know Your Protections

**Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA)** protects federal employees who disclose:
- Violation of law, rule, or regulation
- Gross mismanagement
- Gross waste of funds
- Abuse of authority
- Substantial danger to public health or safety

**You are protected from retaliation** including:
- Termination
- Demotion
- Suspension
- Harassment
- Reassignment

### Secure Your Communications

**Before contacting anyone:**

1. **Do NOT use government devices** - Use personal phone/computer
2. **Do NOT use government email** - Use personal encrypted email
3. **Do NOT discuss at work** - Assume you may be monitored
4. **Document everything** - Keep personal copies (following classification rules)

**Secure Tools:**
- [Signal](https://signal.org/) - Encrypted messaging
- [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) - Encrypted email
- [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) - Anonymous browsing

## Where to Report

### Inspectors General

Every federal agency has an Inspector General (IG) who investigates wrongdoing:

- [Council of the Inspectors General (CIGIE)](https://www.ignet.gov/) - Find your agency's IG
- IGs can receive anonymous complaints
- IGs have subpoena power and investigate independently

### Congress

**Congressional Committees** with oversight jurisdiction:

| Issue Area | Senate Committee | House Committee |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **General government** | Homeland Security & Gov Affairs | Oversight & Accountability |
| **Intelligence** | Select Committee on Intelligence | Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence |
| **Military** | Armed Services | Armed Services |
| **Appropriations** | Appropriations | Appropriations |

**How to contact:**
- Find committee staff contacts on committee websites
- Request to speak with oversight or investigative staff
- You can request confidentiality

### Office of Special Counsel (OSC)

The [Office of Special Counsel](https://osc.gov/) is an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency:

- Investigates prohibited personnel practices
- Protects whistleblowers from retaliation
- Can order corrective action

**File a complaint:** [osc.gov/pages/file-complaint](https://osc.gov/pages/file-complaint.aspx)

## Schedule F and Whistleblower Risks

### The Changed Landscape

With Executive Order 14171 (Schedule F), federal employees in "policy-influencing" positions face:
- Removal from civil service protections
- At-will termination without appeal rights
- No Merit Systems Protection Board recourse

**If you've been reclassified to Schedule F:**
- Whistleblower protections under WPA still apply
- Consult a lawyer before disclosing
- Document any retaliation immediately

### Heightened Precautions

Given Schedule F, whistleblowers should:
1. **Consult legal counsel BEFORE disclosing**
2. **Use only secure, personal communications**
3. **Consider anonymous disclosure channels**
4. **Build external support network before disclosure**

---

## Sustained Actions

### Document Ongoing Concerns

If you're witnessing ongoing wrongdoing:
- Keep a personal log (dates, times, witnesses)
- Save copies of relevant documents to personal storage (following classification rules)
- Note who else witnessed events
- Preserve your own performance records

### Connect with Others

- **Government Accountability Project** hosts support networks
- **POGO** connects whistleblowers facing similar issues
- Consider connecting with journalists who cover your agency

### Testify Before Congress

If asked to testify:
- You have the right to counsel
- You can request closed (non-public) sessions
- Prepare written testimony in advance
- Agencies cannot retaliate for truthful congressional testimony

---

## If You Face Retaliation

### Immediate Steps

1. **Document the retaliation** - Dates, actions, witnesses
2. **File OSC complaint within 45 days** of personnel action
3. **Contact a whistleblower attorney**
4. **Do NOT resign** - This may waive certain protections

### Legal Remedies

- OSC investigation and corrective action
- Merit Systems Protection Board appeal
- Federal court action in some cases
- Congressional intervention
