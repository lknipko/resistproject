## The Current Landscape

Since January 2025, fundamental changes to the structure of American governance have occurred. The old maps no longer apply. Understanding these changes—and knowing how to respond—is essential for every citizen.

**What makes this platform different:**
- **Facts first** — We cite executive orders, court opinions, and legislation directly
- **No spin** — Clear separation between verifiable facts and analysis
- **Action-oriented** — Every issue includes concrete steps you can take today
- **Community-verified** — Contributions are reviewed for accuracy before publication

## Guiding Principles

1. **Primary sources or nothing** — Federal Register, Congress.gov, court filings, .gov domains
2. **Facts and analysis separated** — Readers always know what's verified vs. interpreted
3. **Action over awareness** — Information without action is insufficient
4. **Credibility is paramount** — One bad source undermines everything
5. **Non-partisan framing** — Focus on rights and principles, not party politics
