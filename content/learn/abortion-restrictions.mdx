# Federal Abortion Restrictions

## Quick Summary

Since January 2025, the Trump administration has systematically restricted abortion access through executive orders ending federal funding for abortion services, reinstating the Mexico City Policy to block international abortion funding, rescinding travel allowances for military personnel seeking abortion care, and withholding Title X family planning funds. The FDA has delayed safety reviews of mifepristone until after the 2026 midterms, while multiple Republican-led states have filed lawsuits challenging FDA approval and mail-order access to abortion medication. The administration's potential enforcement of the 1873 Comstock Act could effectively ban abortion nationwide by criminalizing the mailing of abortion pills and medical supplies.

## Facts

### Key Points

- **Executive Order 14182**, "Enforcing the Hyde Amendment," signed January 24, 2025, revoked Biden-era executive orders that had expanded access to reproductive healthcare and directed federal agencies to end taxpayer funding for elective abortion. [source: Executive Order 14182](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/enforcing-the-hyde-amendment/)

- **The Hyde Amendment** is a legislative provision first passed in 1976 that bars the use of federal funds to pay for abortion, except to save the life of the woman or if the pregnancy arises from incest or rape.

### [+] Federal Funding Restrictions

#### The Hyde Amendment and Executive Order 14182

The Hyde Amendment, first passed in 1976, prohibits federal Medicaid funding from covering abortion services except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. Before the Hyde Amendment took effect in 1980, an estimated 300,000 abortions were performed annually using federal funds.

On January 24, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14182, "Enforcing the Hyde Amendment," which:
- Revoked Executive Orders 14076 and 14079 from the Biden administration
- Directed all federal agencies to align spending with Hyde Amendment restrictions
- Stated that "American taxpayers should not be forced to pay" for abortion
- Characterized Biden-era policies as having "embedded abortion funding across multiple federal programs"

[source: White House - Executive Order 14182](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/enforcing-the-hyde-amendment/)

#### Similar Funding Bans Extended to Other Programs

The Hyde Amendment's framework has been extended to:
- **Federal employee health plans** - No abortion coverage for federal workers
- **Federal prisons** - No abortion access for incarcerated women
- **Military healthcare (TRICARE)** - No abortion coverage except rape/incest/life endangerment
- **Peace Corps volunteers** - No abortion coverage
- **International family planning programs** - No funding for foreign organizations

[source: Planned Parenthood Action - Hyde Amendment](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/federal-and-state-bans-and-restrictions-abortion/hyde-amendment)

#### Impact and Criticism

Critics argue the Hyde Amendment disproportionately affects:
- **Low-income women** - An estimated 42% of abortion recipients live below the poverty line
- **Women of color** - Who are overrepresented in Medicaid enrollment
- **Young women** - Who are more likely to be uninsured or on Medicaid
- **Immigrants** - Who have limited access to private insurance

The restriction forces many low-income women to:
1. Delay abortion care while raising money
2. Carry unwanted pregnancies to term
3. Make severe financial sacrifices to afford care

### [+] Medication Abortion Access

#### Current FDA Policy

As of February 2026, the FDA still permits:
- Mifepristone prescription via telehealth
- Mail delivery of abortion pills
- Dispensing by certified pharmacies (in about half of U.S. states, depending on state law)

The two-drug regimen (mifepristone + misoprostol) is approved for terminating pregnancy up to 10 weeks gestation and accounts for approximately 60% of all abortions in the United States.

[source: CNBC - Abortion Pill Access](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/25/abortion-pill-mifepristone-access-trump-fda.html)

#### The Delayed FDA Safety Review

In May 2025, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary ordered a controversial safety review of mifepristone at the request of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The review could:
- Require in-person doctor prescriptions
- End telehealth prescribing
- Ban mail-order delivery
- Remove the drug from the market entirely

However, in December 2025, FDA officials were told to delay the review "until after the midterm elections" in November 2026, likely due to the political sensitivity of the issue.

[source: Truthout - Reproductive Rights Battles 2026](https://truthout.org/articles/major-battles-for-reproductive-rights-in-2026-will-play-out-in-fda-and-courts/)

#### Ongoing Litigation Against Mifepristone

Six Republican-led states have filed three separate lawsuits targeting FDA approval and access:

**Louisiana lawsuit (October 2025):**
- Challenges 2023 FDA regulation allowing telehealth prescription and mail delivery
- Seeks to restore pre-2023 in-person dispensing requirements

**Texas and Florida lawsuit (December 2025):**
- Broader challenge targeting FDA's original 2000 approval of mifepristone
- Could remove the drug from the market entirely if successful

**Missouri and other states:**
- Additional challenges seeking to restrict interstate mailing and telehealth across state lines

[source: U.S. News - Mifepristone Litigation Tracker](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2026-01-05/factbox-us-abortion-pill-access-under-fire-lawsuits-and-regulatory-battles-to-watch-in-2026)

#### Generic Approvals and Industry Response

The FDA approved a second generic version of mifepristone in October 2025, prompting outrage from conservative groups who accused the administration of expanding abortion access. The approval was made before the safety review delay, suggesting internal FDA conflict over abortion policy.

### [+] Comstock Act Threat

#### What Is the Comstock Act?

The Comstock Act is a set of federal laws enacted in 1873 that prohibit:
- Mailing or shipping "obscene, lewd, or lascivious" materials
- Using common carriers (USPS, UPS, FedEx) to transport items "designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion"
- Mailing "any article whatever for the prevention of conception"

The law was named after Anthony Comstock, a postal inspector and anti-vice crusader. It was originally intended to ban contraceptives, love letters, and information about reproductive health, reflecting Victorian-era morality.

[source: Center for Reproductive Rights - What Is the Comstock Act?](https://reproductiverights.org/resources/what-is-the-comstock-act/)

#### Project 2025's Enforcement Strategy

Project 2025's "Mandate for Leadership" explicitly calls for:
- "A campaign to enforce the criminal prohibitions" of the Comstock Act
- Targeting "providers and distributors of abortion pills"
- DOJ prosecution of doctors, pharmacies, and mail carriers

The strategy would not require congressional action—only a reinterpretation of existing law by the Trump Department of Justice.

[source: Center for American Progress - Project 2025 Comstock Act](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/project-2025s-distortion-of-a-reconstruction-era-law-could-enact-a-national-abortion-ban/)

#### Scope of Potential Enforcement

While Project 2025 focuses on abortion pills, the Comstock Act's language is broader:
- **"Anything used in abortions"** - Could include surgical instruments, medical supplies
- **Interstate shipping bans** - Could stop all abortion-related materials from crossing state lines
- **Criminal penalties** - Doctors and providers face up to 5 years in prison for first violation, 10 years for subsequent violations

Legal experts warn this could effectively end abortion nationwide, even in states where abortion is legal, by cutting off the supply chain.

[source: NPR - Comstock Act Could Ban Abortion Nationwide](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/10/1243802678/abortion-comstock-act)

#### Biden-Era Interpretation vs. Trump DOJ

**Biden DOJ guidance (2022):**
The Department of Justice issued guidance stating the Comstock Act does not prohibit mailing mifepristone or misoprostol where the sender lacks intent that the recipient will use them unlawfully. This interpretation allowed continued mail-order access.

**Expected Trump DOJ approach:**
The Trump administration would likely reverse this guidance and adopt a strict interpretation criminalizing all abortion-related mailings, regardless of intent or state law.

[source: TIME - Comstock Act Threat](https://time.com/7014473/comstock-act-project-2025/)

#### Legislative Response

Senator Tina Smith (D-MN) and Representative Pat Ryan (D-NY) have introduced legislation to repeal the Comstock Act entirely, but the bills face steep odds in a Republican-controlled Congress.

### [+] Military and Federal Programs

#### Department of Defense Travel Policy Rescinded

In early 2025, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth rescinded the Biden-era policy that provided:
- **Travel allowances** for service members stationed in states with abortion bans to travel to states where abortion is legal
- **Paid leave** for the travel and procedure
- **Similar coverage** for military dependents

**Impact:**
- Thousands of service members stationed at military bases in abortion-ban states (Texas, Florida, etc.) lost access to coverage
- Female service members now face out-of-pocket costs for travel and lodging
- Creates healthcare disparity based on duty station assignment

[source: National Women's Law Center - Trump Administration Actions](https://nwlc.org/resource/the-trump-administrations-first-actions-in-2025-targeting-patients-providers-and-reproductive-health-care-access/)

#### Title X Family Planning Program

Title X is the only federal program dedicated to providing family planning services to low-income individuals. In April 2025:
- The Trump administration withheld funding for 22 Title X grants
- Administration claimed "potential violations" of DEI and abortion-related executive orders
- Some grants were eventually restored after legal pressure
- The uncertainty led to clinic staffing cuts and service reductions

**What Title X covers:**
- Contraception
- STI testing and treatment
- Cancer screenings
- Pregnancy testing and counseling
- Preventive health services

Abortion services are already prohibited under Title X, but the administration targeted grantees for providing abortion information and referrals.

[source: Guttmacher Institute - Trump Campaign Against SRHR](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/year-one-project-2025-tracking-trump-admins-campaign-against-srhr)

#### Federal Website Censorship

Within days of the Trump administration taking office, federal agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began removing reproductive health information from government websites:
- Abortion care information
- Contraceptive guidance
- Maternal health resources
- Links to reproductive health providers

### [+] State-Level Restrictions

#### Post-Dobbs Landscape

As of early 2026:
- **12 states** have total abortion bans
- **4 states** have 6-week gestational limits (before many women know they're pregnant)
- **At least 26 states** have enacted restrictions of varying severity

[source: Guttmacher Institute - Medication Abortion State Policy](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/medication-abortion)

#### State Medication Abortion Laws

**Restrictive states (2025 legislation):**
- **Texas** - Criminalized helping residents obtain abortion pills from out-of-state
- **Louisiana** - Reclassified mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled substances, requiring special prescription protocols

**Protective states (2025 legislation):**
- Several blue states enacted "shield laws" protecting providers who mail abortion pills to patients in restrictive states
- Established legal defenses against extradition and civil liability

[source: MultiState - State Abortion Legislation 2025](https://www.multistate.us/insider/2026/1/23/state-abortion-legislation-tackled-medication-access-in-2025)

#### 2026 Legislative Outlook

Abortion medication is expected to be a major topic of debate in state legislatures in 2026:
- **Red states** may replicate Texas and Louisiana's restrictive laws
- **Blue states** will likely enact additional provider and patient protections
- **Battleground states** will see intense legislative fights

## Analysis

### What This Means

**A Multi-Pronged Strategy to End Abortion Access**

The Trump administration is pursuing abortion restrictions through four complementary approaches:

1. **Funding restrictions** - Cut off government payment for abortion services
2. **Regulatory pressure** - Use FDA and HHS to restrict medication abortion
3. **Legal enforcement** - Encourage state lawsuits and threaten Comstock Act prosecution
4. **International policy** - Characterize abortion as a human rights violation globally

This strategy aims to make abortion functionally inaccessible even in states where it remains legal, without requiring congressional action or a Supreme Court ruling.

**The Comstock Act Is the Nuclear Option**

If enforced, the Comstock Act would:
- Criminalize mailing abortion pills (60% of all U.S. abortions)
- Potentially ban mailing surgical instruments and medical supplies
- Threaten doctors, pharmacies, and healthcare providers with federal prosecution
- Override state laws protecting abortion access

This would constitute a de facto national abortion ban accomplished through executive action alone.

**Economic Barriers Replace Legal Barriers**

By defunding Planned Parenthood, cutting Title X, eliminating military travel coverage, and maintaining Hyde Amendment restrictions, the administration is making abortion prohibitively expensive for low-income Americans—particularly those in states with abortion bans who must travel out of state.

**The 2026 Midterms Are Decisive**

The FDA's decision to delay the mifepristone safety review until after the November 2026 midterm elections reveals the political calculation behind abortion policy. The administration fears voter backlash if abortion medication is restricted before the election.

### Who Is Affected

**Low-Income Women (Disproportionate Impact)**

- **Medicaid recipients** cannot use federal health coverage for abortion (Hyde Amendment)
- **42% of abortion seekers** live below the poverty line
- **Cost barriers** force delays in care or carrying unwanted pregnancies to term
- **Travel costs** to reach abortion providers can exceed the cost of the procedure itself

**Military Service Members and Dependents**

- **Thousands of service members** stationed at bases in abortion-ban states lost travel coverage
- **Healthcare access determined by duty station** - service members have no choice in where they're stationed
- **Out-of-pocket costs** for travel and lodging create financial hardship

**Women in States with Abortion Bans**

- **16 states** with total bans or 6-week limits
- **Telemedicine and mail-order pills** may become unavailable if Comstock Act is enforced
- **Interstate travel** may be criminalized by state laws
- **Legal risks** for seeking care even in legal states

**Healthcare Providers**

- **Doctors and pharmacists** face federal prosecution if Comstock Act is enforced (5-10 years in prison)
- **Planned Parenthood clinics** closing due to defunding (dozens nationwide in 2025)
- **Liability concerns** discourage providers from offering abortion care even where legal

**International Organizations**

- **Foreign NGOs** receiving U.S. aid cannot provide or even discuss abortion (Mexico City Policy)
- **Global family planning programs** lose funding
- **U.S. diplomatic shift** characterizing abortion as human rights violation undermines international reproductive rights advocacy

### The Comstock Act Strategy

**Why This Law Matters Now**

The Comstock Act has been described as a "zombie law"—technically still on the books but not enforced for decades. Its revival would represent one of the most dramatic shifts in federal abortion policy in modern history.

**Project 2025's Blueprint**

The strategy outlined in Project 2025 is clear:
1. The Trump DOJ reverses Biden-era guidance that narrowly interpreted the Comstock Act
2. Federal prosecutors begin targeting abortion pill manufacturers, pharmacies, and mail carriers
3. The threat of prosecution forces providers to stop mailing pills
4. Medication abortion access collapses nationwide within months

**Constitutional and Legal Questions**

The Comstock Act's enforcement faces several legal challenges:
- **Commerce Clause** - Does Congress have authority to ban interstate shipment of legal medical products?
- **First Amendment** - Does the law impermissibly restrict speech about abortion?
- **Vagueness** - Is the law too vague to provide fair notice of what conduct is prohibited?
- **State sovereignty** - Can federal law override state abortion protections?

However, with a 6-3 conservative Supreme Court majority, challenges to Comstock enforcement may fail.

**The Political Calculus**

The FDA's decision to delay the mifepristone review until after the 2026 midterms reveals the administration's awareness that aggressive abortion restrictions are politically unpopular:
- **Abortion ballot measures** won in 7 out of 7 states in 2024, including red states like Kansas and Kentucky
- **Polling consistently shows** majority support for abortion access
- **2026 midterms** will determine whether Democrats can regain control of Congress and block further restrictions

**What Happens After 2026**

If Republicans maintain control of Congress after the midterms, expect:
- Full enforcement of the Comstock Act
- Mifepristone removed from the market or severely restricted
- Additional federal legislation restricting abortion
- Potential push for fetal personhood laws

If Democrats gain control:
- Legislative repeal of the Comstock Act
- Codification of abortion rights into federal law
- Restoration of Title X and international family planning funding
- Reversal of executive orders restricting abortion access
