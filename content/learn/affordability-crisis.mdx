# The Affordability Crisis: How Policy Is Squeezing American Families

## Quick Summary

American families face a compounding affordability crisis driven by multiple simultaneous policy choices: tariffs adding $1,500/year to household costs; ACA premium subsidies that expired in 2025 doubling health insurance costs for 22 million people; housing costs requiring 70% of median income for a down payment; and food prices up 34% since 2020. These pressures are not random — they are the cumulative result of specific policy decisions. ~70% of Americans report struggling to afford food, housing, or healthcare. Working-class Americans without college degrees are the hardest hit.

## Facts

### Key Points

- **Tariffs:** Average household burden is **$1,500/year** in 2026; 97% of tariff costs paid by U.S. importers and consumers (Harvard/IMF research) [source: Peterson Institute — Tariff Household Impact](https://www.piie.com)

- **Healthcare:** ACA enhanced subsidies expired end of 2025; **22 million Americans** saw premiums more than double in January 2026; **3.2 million people** dropped coverage [source: KFF — ACA Premium Analysis 2026](https://www.kff.org)

- **Housing:** Median U.S. home price requires a down payment equal to **70% of median annual income**; housing costs as a share of income are at a 40-year high [source: National Association of Realtors — Affordability Index](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics/housing-affordability-index)

- **Food:** Grocery prices are **34% higher** than in 2020; food insecurity reached 18% of U.S. households in 2025 — the highest level since 2011 [source: USDA Economic Research Service — Food Security](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/)

- **The squeeze is cumulative:** A median-income working-class family now faces $3,000-$5,000 more per year in unavoidable costs compared to 2022

### [+] Tariffs & Household Costs

#### How Tariffs Raise Prices

Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers at the border and passed directly to consumers as higher prices. The mechanism is not theoretical — it is how the collection system operates (U.S. Customs and Border Protection collects from U.S. companies, not foreign exporters).

**2026 tariff burden by category:**

| Category | Average Household Impact | Notes |
|----------|--------------------------|-------|
| Electronics (phones, laptops, appliances) | $280-$520/year | China tariffs 30-145% |
| Clothing and footwear | $150-$300/year | Most manufactured in tariffed countries |
| Groceries (produce, meat) | $200-$400/year | Mexico, Canada tariffs on agricultural goods |
| Vehicles and auto parts | One-time $2,500-$12,000 | 25% auto tariff |
| Construction (lumber, steel) | $3,000-$8,000 per new home | Raised cost of new housing construction |

**Overall:** The Peterson Institute estimates $1,500/year average household tariff burden under the 2026 Section 122 15% global tariff (revised down from CBO's earlier $2,100-$3,800 projection under higher IEEPA rates).

**Research consensus:** Harvard economists and IMF researchers confirm 97% of tariff costs are absorbed by U.S. importers and consumers, not by foreign exporters.

### [+] Healthcare Costs

#### ACA Subsidy Expiration

The Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium subsidies, created by the American Rescue Plan (2021) and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act (2022), **expired at the end of 2025**. Congress declined to extend them in the One Big Beautiful Budget Act. The subsidies had kept premiums manageable for people earning 100-400% of the federal poverty level.

**Impact (January 2026):**
- **22 million Americans** in ACA marketplace plans saw immediate premium increases
- Average monthly premium increase: **$487/month for a family of four** (KFF analysis)
- **3.2 million people** dropped coverage rather than pay higher premiums (CMS preliminary data)
- States with the largest enrollment drops: Texas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina — states without Medicaid expansion

**What this means in dollars:**
- A 45-year-old individual earning $45,000/year (220% FPL) went from ~$150/month to ~$490/month
- A family of four at $70,000/year went from ~$250/month to ~$740/month
- Many small business owners and self-employed workers are in this group

#### Medicaid Cuts (OBBBA)

The One Big Beautiful Budget Act also cut Medicaid by reducing federal matching funds and adding work requirements. See [OBBBA and Medicaid](/learn/obbba-medicaid) for full details. Key impact on affordability:
- An estimated 8.6 million people projected to lose Medicaid coverage by 2027
- As Medicaid coverage shrinks, uninsured people delay care until emergencies — increasing costs for everyone

### [+] Housing

#### The Down Payment Barrier

The median U.S. home price reached $428,700 in Q4 2025 (National Association of Realtors). A standard 20% down payment = $85,740 — equal to **70% of the median U.S. household's annual income** ($77,500).

- First-time homebuyers now take an average of **12.4 years** to save a down payment (up from 7.2 years in 2015)
- Mortgage rates remained above 6.5% through early 2026 — tariffs on construction materials (lumber +25%, steel +25%) have raised new home construction costs by $3,000-$8,000 per unit
- Institutional investors (hedge funds, REITs) own approximately **3.8% of all single-family homes**, concentrated in entry-level price ranges — reducing supply for first-time buyers

**Rent is not the solution:** Median rent for a 2-bedroom apartment is $1,980/month nationally; in major metros (NYC, LA, Seattle, DC, Miami) it exceeds $2,800.

**Trump's housing contradiction:** Trump pledged "affordability" on the campaign trail but stated publicly that he does not want to drive housing prices down (Mar-a-Lago comments, January 2026). New home construction costs are rising due to lumber and steel tariffs. No meaningful housing supply legislation has been signed.

### [+] Food Costs

- **34% cumulative food price increase since 2020:** Eggs (+127%), beef (+38%), bread (+28%), produce (+22%)
- **18% of U.S. households** experienced food insecurity in 2025 — highest since 2011 (USDA)
- **SNAP benefits** did not fully keep pace with food inflation; purchasing power declined approximately 12% in real terms
- **Food bank demand** increased 23% nationally in 2025; Feeding America reports many food banks are rationing distributions

**Connection to tariffs:** Agricultural tariff retaliation from Canada, China, and the EU reduced export markets for U.S. farmers, contributing to higher domestic prices on some goods. Mexican produce tariffs raised prices on avocados, tomatoes, and berries.

### [+] Who Is Hardest Hit

#### Working-Class Americans Without College Degrees

- Less likely to have employer-sponsored health insurance (more likely to be in ACA marketplace or uninsured)
- Spend a higher share of income on food, clothing, and consumer goods — making tariff impacts proportionally larger
- More likely to be renters facing high rents without home equity to cushion costs
- More likely to be employed in industries (manufacturing, construction, retail) directly affected by tariff-driven layoffs

**Key data:**
- Households in the bottom income quintile spend **17% of income on food** vs. 6% for top quintile — making food inflation much more severe proportionally
- The bottom 40% of earners spend over **90% of income on necessities** (housing, food, healthcare, transportation) — leaving almost no buffer for cost increases

[source: BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cex/)

#### Specific Vulnerable Groups

- **Self-employed and small business owners:** Highest exposure to ACA subsidy loss (no employer coverage)
- **Rural Americans:** Fewer affordable alternatives; higher transportation costs; limited access to food banks
- **Seniors on fixed incomes:** Healthcare cost increases disproportionate; Social Security COLA formula may not capture actual expense increases
- **Families with children:** Higher food costs; school meal program budgets under pressure

### [+] The Compounding Effect

What makes 2026 different from prior periods of inflation is the **simultaneous** nature of multiple cost drivers, none of which are temporary:

| Cost Driver | Annual Increase | Cause |
|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Tariffs | +$1,500 average | Policy choice (Section 122) |
| ACA premium loss | +$3,000-$6,000/family | Policy choice (Congress declined to extend subsidies) |
| Housing costs | Ongoing 5-8%/yr | Supply shortage + investor purchasing + tariff on materials |
| Food | Ongoing above-inflation | Supply chain + retaliatory tariffs |

**A median-income family simultaneously facing all four** is looking at $6,000-$10,000 more per year in unavoidable expenses than in 2022 — without a commensurate increase in wages.

DOGE service cuts add a further dimension: as federal services are cut (Social Security processing delays, SNAP administrative barriers, Medicaid work requirement compliance costs), individuals bear more administrative and financial burden that was previously handled by government.

## Analysis

The affordability crisis is not random. It is the cumulative result of specific policy choices — each of which was presented as benefiting workers and families, and each of which has had the opposite effect.

### What This Means

**A policy-created squeeze:** Inflation in 2021-2022 was driven largely by supply chain disruptions and stimulus spending. The 2026 affordability crisis is different — it is being actively generated by policy: tariffs raise consumer prices, subsidy expiration raises healthcare costs, institutional investor deregulation reduces housing supply. The administration made these choices; they can be unmade by Congress.

**The regressive distribution:** Every cost increase in this crisis falls disproportionately on lower-income households. Tariffs are a regressive tax. ACA subsidy loss hits people who earn too much for Medicaid and too little for affordable employer coverage. Rising rents hurt renters, not homeowners. This is not a neutral outcome — it is a transfer of financial burden from wealthier Americans (who own homes, have employer coverage, and have more discretionary income) to working-class and middle-class families.

### Who's Affected

- **22 million Americans** who lost ACA subsidy support
- **3.2 million** who dropped health coverage due to unaffordable premiums
- **18%** of U.S. households experiencing food insecurity
- Every American consumer paying tariff-inflated prices
- Every renter or aspiring homeowner in a supply-constrained market

### The Political Contradiction

President Trump ran explicitly on an "affordability" platform — promising to lower prices, make housing affordable, and reduce the burden on working families. The policy record to date has produced the opposite outcome on every major affordability metric:

- **Food prices:** Higher (tariff-driven, retaliatory tariff on agricultural exports)
- **Healthcare costs:** Higher (ACA subsidy expiration, Medicaid cuts)
- **Housing costs:** Higher (construction material tariffs, no supply legislation)
- **Consumer goods prices:** Higher (tariffs on electronics, clothing, appliances)

Trump's statement that he does not want to "drive housing prices down" — made at a private event in January 2026 — encapsulates the contradiction: a president whose base includes millions of homebuyers and renters who cannot afford housing, explicitly rejecting the policy goal that would help them.
