## Facts

### What the Executive Order Does

**The Core Claim:**

EO 14160 directs federal agencies to adopt a restrictive interpretation of the 14th Amendment phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof."

The 14th Amendment states:
> "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States."

The administration argues this phrase requires "complete political allegiance" to the United States, which foreign nationals cannot possess.

**Who Is Excluded:**

Under EO 14160, children born in the U.S. are NOT recognized as citizens if their parents are:

1. **Unlawfully present** in the United States, OR
2. **Lawfully present but in "temporary" status** (tourists, students, temporary workers like H-1B holders) without permanent settlement authorization

**Implementation (USCIS Policy Alert IP-2025-0001):**

The State Department and Social Security Administration are directed to:
- Deny passports to children who fall under the new exclusions
- Deny Social Security Numbers to affected children
- Request proof of parental immigration status during benefit applications

The policy creates a new administrative category: **"Registered Non-Citizen Births"**
- States still issue birth certificates (vital records are state-controlled)
- Federal government denies citizenship recognition
- Children may be rendered effectively stateless if parents' home countries also don't claim them

### Current Litigation Status

**Lead Case: Trump v. Barbara** (Supreme Court Docket 25-365)

- Class action challenging EO 14160
- District court in New Hampshire initially granted preliminary injunction
- Due to *Trump v. CASA* ruling (see [Universal Injunctions Ended](/learn/casa-decision)), injunction only protects named plaintiffs in the class
- Administration continues enforcement against individuals not covered by court orders

<SourceLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._Barbara">Trump v. Barbara - Wikipedia</SourceLink>

**Geographic Fragmentation:**

A citizen's child may or may not have their citizenship recognized depending on:
- Whether the parents have joined a lawsuit
- Which judicial district they're in
- Whether their state AG has filed suit

## Analysis

### What This Means

EO 14160 attempts to amend the Constitution through executive action, bypassing the Article V amendment process. For 150+ years, the 14th Amendment has been interpreted to grant citizenship to virtually all children born on U.S. soil (with narrow exceptions for children of diplomats and enemy forces).

**The Legal Theory:**

The administration's argument hinges on reinterpreting "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" to mean political allegiance rather than legal jurisdiction. Legal scholars widely consider this interpretation contrary to established precedent, including *United States v. Wong Kim Ark* (1898), which affirmed birthright citizenship for children of non-citizen residents.

**The Bureaucratic Strategy:**

By framing this as a regulatory interpretation of passport issuance rules and INA procedures, the administration forces courts to address administrative law questions first—buying time for implementation while litigation proceeds.

**The Chilling Effect:**

The inclusion of "temporary status" parents (not just undocumented immigrants) vastly expands impact. Legal residents—international students, H-1B workers, researchers—may avoid the U.S. entirely if their children born here won't receive citizenship. This affects U.S. competitiveness for global talent.

### Who Is Affected

- **Children born to undocumented parents**: Denied passports and SSNs; may be effectively stateless
- **Children born to temporary visa holders**: Includes H-1B (tech workers), F-1 (students), J-1 (exchange visitors), B-1/B-2 (tourists)
- **Mixed-status families**: U.S. citizen parent + non-citizen parent may face complications
- **U.S. employers**: Difficulty attracting international talent who may have children during assignment
- **Universities**: International graduate students may choose other countries

### Legal/Policy Context

**Constitutional Foundation:**

The 14th Amendment (1868) was enacted after the Civil War specifically to overturn *Dred Scott v. Sandford* and guarantee citizenship to formerly enslaved people and their descendants. The text was deliberately broad.

**Precedent:**

*United States v. Wong Kim Ark* (1898) established that a child born in the U.S. to Chinese nationals (who were themselves barred from citizenship under the Chinese Exclusion Act) was a U.S. citizen by birth. This has been controlling precedent for 125+ years.

**Impact of Trump v. CASA:**

Because universal injunctions are no longer available, even if courts find EO 14160 unconstitutional, relief extends only to plaintiffs. This means:
- Families must actively join lawsuits to gain protection
- The administration can continue enforcement elsewhere
- A patchwork of citizenship recognition emerges across jurisdictions
