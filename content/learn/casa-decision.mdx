# Trump v. CASA: The End of Universal Injunctions

## Quick Summary

In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that federal district courts lack the statutory authority to issue "universal" or "nationwide" injunctions that bar enforcement of a policy against non-parties to the lawsuit.

    Signed June 27, 2025, this decision fundamentally changes civil rights litigation strategy, requiring advocates to recruit plaintiffs in every jurisdiction rather than achieve nationwide protection through a single case.

### The Ruling

**What the Court Held:**

In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that federal district courts **lack the statutory authority** to issue "universal" or "nationwide" injunctions that bar enforcement of a policy against non-parties to the lawsuit.

> An injunction can only protect the specific plaintiffs in the lawsuit to the extent necessary to provide them "complete relief."

**What This Means in Practice:**

| Before CASA | After CASA |
|-------------|------------|
| Judge in Hawaii finds executive order unconstitutional → Order blocked nationwide | Judge in Hawaii finds executive order unconstitutional → Order blocked only for plaintiffs in that case |
| One lawsuit can stop a policy everywhere | Administration can continue enforcing policy in all other jurisdictions |
| Advocacy groups could sue "on behalf of the public" | Each affected person must join a lawsuit or file their own |

### The Exception: State Standing

The Court left a narrow opening: when a **State** is the plaintiff, relief might need to be broader to provide the State "complete relief" for its residents.

> This elevates State Attorneys General to the primary defenders of civil rights, as they may be the only actors with standing to seek relief covering a broad population.

## Analysis

### What This Means

**The End of the "Silver Bullet" Lawsuit:**

For decades, civil rights organizations could challenge unconstitutional policies by finding sympathetic plaintiffs in favorable jurisdictions. A single district court victory could halt nationwide enforcement while appeals proceeded. This mechanism is now broken.

**Fragmented Federalism:**

Rights are no longer uniform across the country. Consider Executive Order 14160 (birthright citizenship):
- A court in California rules it unconstitutional for plaintiffs in that case
- The administration continues enforcement in Texas, Florida, and 48 other states
- A family's child may or may not be recognized as a citizen depending on:
  - Whether the family has joined a lawsuit
  - Which judicial district they're in
  - Whether their State AG has filed suit

**The Asymmetric Advantage:**

The administration can lose case after case in different jurisdictions while continuing to enforce policies against the vast majority of affected people. The burden shifts entirely to those harmed to affirmatively seek legal protection.

### Who Is Affected

- **Anyone harmed by federal policy**: Must now affirmatively join litigation to receive protection
- **Civil rights organizations**: Strategy must shift from test cases to mass recruitment of plaintiffs
- **State Attorneys General**: Become critical actors; their decision to sue (or not) determines protection for state residents
- **People in states with aligned AGs**: May have no protection if their AG refuses to challenge federal policies
- **Legal system**: Courts will face thousands of individual claims instead of consolidated cases

### Legal/Policy Context

**Historical Context:**

Universal injunctions became common during both the Obama and Trump administrations as a tool for the opposing party to block executive actions. Critics argued this gave individual district judges too much power; supporters argued it was necessary to prevent constitutional violations from harming people during lengthy appeals.

**The New Litigation Strategy:**

With universal injunctions unavailable, advocates must pursue:
1. **Class actions**: Certify classes covering as many affected people as possible
2. **Multi-state AG coalitions**: Pressure State AGs to file joint litigation
3. **Plaintiff recruitment**: Actively find affected individuals in every judicial district
4. **Parallel filing**: File similar cases in multiple circuits simultaneously
