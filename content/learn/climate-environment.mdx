# Climate & Environmental Rollbacks

## Quick Summary

On his first day in office, President Trump signed executive orders withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, launching the most sweeping environmental deregulation in American history. The EPA has been gutted through budget cuts exceeding 65%, mass staff reductions, dissolution of scientific advisory boards, and a directive to stop assigning monetary value to human life in cost-benefit analyses for pollution regulations. Federal public lands have been opened to oil, gas, and mining extraction at unprecedented scale, while the 10-for-1 deregulation executive order has paralyzed the agency's ability to issue new environmental protections.

## Facts

### Key Points

- **Paris Agreement withdrawal:** The U.S. formally began withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement on January 20, 2025, via Executive Order 14166, "Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements." The U.S. is the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, responsible for approximately 13% of global emissions. [source: Executive Order 14166](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025-02068/putting-america-first-in-international-environmental-agreements)

- **EPA budget slashed by over 65%:** The proposed FY2026 budget cuts EPA funding from approximately $9.2 billion to $3.2 billion, the lowest level in the agency's history adjusting for inflation. Over 6,000 EPA employees have been fired, placed on leave, or offered buyouts. [source: EDF - Deep EPA Cuts Put Public Health at Risk](https://www.edf.org/deep-epa-cuts-put-public-health-risk)

- **Value of human life eliminated from regulatory analysis:** EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin directed the agency to stop using the "Value of a Statistical Life" (VSL) -- currently set at approximately $11.8 million per life -- when calculating whether pollution regulations are worth their cost. This metric has been the foundation of every major clean air and water regulation for decades. [source: EPA Mortality Risk Valuation](https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/mortality-risk-valuation)

- **10-for-1 deregulation mandate:** Executive Order 14192, "Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation," requires agencies to repeal 10 existing regulations for every new one issued, with a net zero regulatory cost cap. This effectively prevents EPA from issuing any new environmental protections. [source: Executive Order 14192](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/05/2025-02349/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation)

- **Public lands opened to extraction:** Executive Order 14174, "Unleashing American Energy," revoked the moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters, opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, and directed review of all national monument designations for potential reduction. [source: Executive Order 14174](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025-02054/unleashing-american-energy)

- **Clean Power Plan replacement repealed:** EPA moved to eliminate the Biden-era power plant emission rules that would have required coal and gas plants to capture 90% of carbon emissions or shut down by 2032. [source: Federal Register - Repeal of GHG Emissions Standards for Power Plants](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/06/17/2025-10991/repeal-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-standards-for-fossil-fuel-fired-electric-generating-units)

- **NEPA streamlined to fast-track projects:** Executive orders directed agencies to use categorical exclusions to bypass environmental review for energy projects. [source: Federal Register - EO 14154](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025-02054/unleashing-american-energy)

- **Scientific advisory boards dissolved:** EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) were defunded and reconstituted with industry-aligned members, reversing the requirement that members be independent of regulated industries. [source: NPR - EPA Science Advisory Committees Dismissed](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/29/nx-s1-5278637/why-members-of-two-epa-science-advisory-committees-were-let-go)

### [+] Paris Climate Agreement Withdrawal

#### The Legal Process

On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14166, "Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements," directing the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. This was the second withdrawal -- Trump had previously withdrawn during his first term in 2017, with the process completed in November 2020. President Biden rejoined in February 2021.

Under Article 28 of the Paris Agreement, withdrawal takes one year from notification to the UN Secretary-General. The formal notification was submitted on January 20, 2025, making the withdrawal effective January 20, 2026.

[source: Federal Register - EO 14166](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025-02068/putting-america-first-in-international-environmental-agreements)

#### What the Paris Agreement Required

The Paris Agreement (2015) committed 195 nations to:
- Limit global warming to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, with efforts toward 1.5 degrees C
- Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) -- voluntary emission reduction targets
- The U.S. NDC under Biden: 50-52% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 2005 levels by 2030
- Climate finance contributions to developing nations ($100 billion/year global target)
- Transparency framework for reporting emissions and progress

[source: UNFCCC Paris Agreement Full Text](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/english_paris_agreement.pdf)

#### Impact on Global Climate Commitments

The U.S. withdrawal has cascading effects:
- The U.S. is responsible for approximately 25% of cumulative historical CO2 emissions since 1850
- Current annual emissions: approximately 5.2 billion metric tons CO2 (second only to China)
- Without the U.S., meeting the 1.5 degrees C target becomes significantly more difficult
- Other nations may weaken their own commitments citing U.S. withdrawal
- The U.S. Green Climate Fund contributions ($3 billion pledged, $1 billion delivered under Obama) have been halted

[source: Global Carbon Project Emissions Data](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/)

#### U.S. Emissions Trajectory

Without federal climate policy:
- U.S. emissions projected to remain flat or increase through 2030 rather than declining
- Power sector emissions may rise as coal plant retirements slow
- Transportation sector emissions continue increasing
- The U.S. will not meet its Paris NDC commitment of 50-52% reduction by 2030

### [+] EPA Gutting: Budget, Staff, and Authority

#### [+] Budget Cuts

The proposed FY2026 EPA budget represents the most severe funding reduction in the agency's 55-year history:

| Category | FY2024 Enacted | FY2026 Proposed | Reduction |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Total EPA Budget | ~$9.2 billion | ~$3.2 billion | ~65% |
| Enforcement and Compliance | ~$580 million | ~$210 million | ~64% |
| Science and Technology | ~$680 million | ~$250 million | ~63% |
| Superfund Cleanup | ~$1.8 billion | ~$600 million | ~67% |
| State and Tribal Grants | ~$4.0 billion | ~$1.2 billion | ~70% |
| Clean Water State Revolving Fund | ~$1.6 billion | ~$400 million | ~75% |

[source: EPA FY2026 Budget in Brief](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2025-05/fy-2026-epa-bib.pdf)

#### [+] Staff Reductions

EPA staffing has been reduced through multiple mechanisms:
- **Deferred Resignation Program:** Approximately 1,500 EPA employees accepted the "Fork in the Road" buyout offer in February 2025
- **Reduction in Force (RIF):** Approximately 3,500 additional employees were notified of layoffs in March-April 2025
- **Probationary employee terminations:** Over 400 employees on probationary status were fired in February 2025
- **Hiring freeze:** All new hiring frozen indefinitely
- Total remaining workforce projected at fewer than 8,000, down from approximately 15,000

[source: EPA Announces Reduction in Force](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-reduction-force-reorganization-efforts-save-taxpayers-nearly-three)

#### [+] Program Eliminations

Key programs defunded or eliminated:
- **Environmental Justice programs** -- Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights disbanded
- **Climate Change Division** -- Entire division eliminated
- **ENERGY STAR program** -- Funding eliminated
- **Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)** -- Proposed for elimination
- **Chemical Risk Evaluation Program** -- Staff reduced, timeline extended
- **Air Quality Monitoring grants** -- Reduced by over 50%

[source: EPA Congressional Budget Justification FY2026](https://www.epa.gov/planandbudget/cj)

#### [+] Enforcement Collapse

EPA enforcement actions have declined precipitously:
- Civil enforcement case initiations down approximately 70% compared to FY2023
- Criminal enforcement referrals down approximately 80%
- Penalties assessed reduced by over 60%
- Compliance inspections halved
- Consent decrees with violators being renegotiated on more favorable terms for industry

### [+] Eliminating the Value of Human Life

#### What Is the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL)?

The Value of a Statistical Life is not a statement about what a human life is "worth." It is an economic metric derived from studying how much people are willing to pay to reduce their risk of death. EPA has used the VSL -- currently approximately $11.8 million (2024 dollars) -- for decades to calculate whether the health benefits of a proposed regulation outweigh its compliance costs.

**How VSL works in practice:**
- A proposed rule to reduce particulate matter air pollution costs industry $2 billion annually to implement
- The rule is projected to prevent 300 premature deaths per year
- Benefits calculation: 300 lives x $11.8 million = $3.54 billion in benefits
- Since $3.54B in benefits exceeds $2B in costs, the rule is justified

Without the VSL, only the $2 billion cost appears in the analysis. The health benefits are described qualitatively but not quantified in dollar terms, making it nearly impossible to justify any regulation that imposes costs on industry.

[source: EPA Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses](https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/guidelines-preparing-economic-analyses)

#### The Directive

In early 2025, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin directed career staff to stop using the VSL in regulatory cost-benefit analyses. The directive was communicated internally and through OMB Circular A-4 revision guidance. Agencies were instructed to:

- Remove VSL-based calculations from pending regulatory analyses
- Present costs to industry without corresponding monetized health benefits
- Describe health benefits in qualitative terms only (e.g., "some reduction in respiratory illness")
- Apply discount rates that minimize the present value of future health benefits

This approach systematically ensures that costs always appear to exceed benefits, creating a mathematical impossibility for new health-based regulations.

[source: OMB Circular A-4 (Revised Nov. 2023)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CircularA-4Appendix.pdf)

#### Regulations Affected

Virtually every major EPA health regulation has relied on VSL analysis:

| Regulation | Deaths Prevented Annually | Monetized Benefit (VSL) |
|-----------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Clean Air Act PM2.5 standards | ~13,000 | ~$150 billion |
| Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) | ~11,000 | ~$130 billion |
| Clean Power Plan (2015) | ~3,600 | ~$42 billion |
| Lead and Copper Rule | ~1,000 | ~$12 billion |
| Cross-State Air Pollution Rule | ~2,700 | ~$32 billion |
| National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) | ~4,200 | ~$50 billion |

Without VSL, none of these regulations could have been justified under cost-benefit analysis, since industry compliance costs would have appeared to exceed all quantifiable benefits.

[source: EPA Retrospective Cost-Benefit Analyses](https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/benefits-and-costs-clean-air-act)

#### Impact on Pending and Future Rules

The VSL elimination directly affects:
- **Pending PM2.5 revisions** -- The Biden-era tightening of fine particulate matter standards from 12 to 9 micrograms per cubic meter is being reconsidered
- **PFAS drinking water standards** -- The maximum contaminant levels for PFAS chemicals set in 2024 are under review
- **Lead paint hazard standards** -- Proposed updates to the lead paint Renovation, Repair and Painting rule suspended
- **All future regulations** -- Any new health-protective regulation faces an effectively insurmountable cost-benefit hurdle

### [+] Public Lands Under Threat

#### [+] Executive Order 14174: Unleashing American Energy

Signed January 20, 2025, EO 14174 directed:
- Immediate resumption of oil, gas, and mineral leasing on all federal lands and waters
- Revocation of Biden's temporary moratorium on new oil and gas leasing
- Review of all areas withdrawn from leasing under the Antiquities Act or other authorities
- Expedited permitting for energy infrastructure on federal lands

#### [+] Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR)

The 1002 Area of the Arctic Refuge -- 1.56 million acres on Alaska's North Slope -- has been opened to oil and gas leasing:
- The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 mandated two lease sales by December 2024
- Biden's Interior Department had attempted to limit leasing within ANWR
- Trump's Interior Department rescinded all Biden-era protections
- The 1002 Area is calving habitat for the Porcupine caribou herd (approximately 200,000 animals)
- It is sacred territory for the Gwich'in people

[source: BLM Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.blm.gov/programs/energy-and-minerals/oil-and-gas/about/alaska/coastal-plain-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge)

#### [+] National Monuments Under Review

Executive Order 14174 directed Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to review national monument designations for potential boundary reductions or revocations. Monuments at risk include:

- **Bears Ears National Monument** (Utah) -- 1.36 million acres, designated 2016 by Obama, restored 2021 by Biden after Trump's 2017 reduction
- **Grand Staircase-Escalante** (Utah) -- 1.87 million acres, designated 1996 by Clinton
- **Northeast Canyons and Seamounts** (Atlantic) -- 4,913 square miles of marine area
- **Basin and Range** (Nevada) -- 704,000 acres

#### [+] Offshore Drilling Expansion

The administration has:
- Revoked Biden's withdrawal of federal waters from offshore leasing in the Arctic Ocean, Eastern Gulf of Mexico, and Atlantic coast
- Directed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to develop a new 5-year offshore leasing program maximizing lease sales
- Proposed opening the Eastern Gulf of Mexico to drilling despite Florida's bipartisan opposition
- Reopened previously protected areas in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas

### [+] Clean Air and Water Rollbacks

#### [+] Clean Air Act Rollbacks

**Power Plant Emissions:**
- EPA moved to repeal the Biden-era Clean Power Plan 2.0 rules requiring coal and natural gas plants to capture 90% of CO2 emissions by 2032 or shut down
- Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) under review for potential weakening
- Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (the "Good Neighbor" rule) stayed by the Supreme Court in June 2024; EPA has not proposed a replacement

**Vehicle Emissions:**
- EPA proposed weakening Biden-era tailpipe emission standards that would have required approximately 56% of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2032
- Revoked California's Clean Air Act waiver allowing the state to set stricter vehicle emission standards
- Over a dozen states that follow California's standards are affected
- Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards frozen at 2020 levels

**Air Quality Standards:**
- PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) standard tightening from 12 to 9 micrograms per cubic meter under review for rollback
- Ozone (smog) standards under review
- Methane emissions regulations for oil and gas operations repealed
- New Source Performance Standards for power plants weakened

[source: EPA Launches Biggest Deregulatory Action in U.S. History](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-launches-biggest-deregulatory-action-us-history)

#### [+] Clean Water Act Rollbacks

**Waters of the United States (WOTUS):**
- The Sackett v. EPA decision (2023) already narrowed Clean Water Act jurisdiction
- EPA proposed further narrowing the definition of "waters of the United States"
- Wetlands protections significantly reduced -- isolated wetlands no longer covered
- Intermittent and ephemeral streams losing federal protection

**PFAS (Forever Chemicals):**
- The 2024 PFAS drinking water standards (maximum contaminant levels of 4 parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS) under review
- EPA enforcement of PFAS contamination cleanup slowed
- Superfund designation of PFAS as hazardous substances under reconsideration

**Lead in Drinking Water:**
- Biden-era Lead and Copper Rule improvements requiring replacement of all lead service lines within 10 years placed under review
- Funding for lead pipe replacement through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law being redirected

[source: Federal Register - PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/26/2024-07773/pfas-national-primary-drinking-water-regulation)

#### [+] Projected Health Impacts

The American Lung Association and public health researchers have estimated:
- Repealing PM2.5 standards could result in 4,500 additional premature deaths annually
- Weakening vehicle emission standards increases smog-related asthma hospitalizations by approximately 100,000 per year
- Rolling back mercury standards exposes 300,000+ children to neurotoxic mercury levels
- Weakening PFAS standards leaves millions exposed to known carcinogens in drinking water

### [+] The 10-for-1 Deregulation Rule

#### Executive Order 14192

Signed January 31, 2025, Executive Order 14192, "Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation," requires:
- For every one new regulation issued, 10 existing regulations must be repealed
- Net regulatory cost cap of zero -- total new regulatory costs cannot exceed zero
- Agencies must submit deregulatory agendas to OMB for approval
- OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has veto authority over all new rules
- Exemptions only for emergencies, military, or national security

[source: Federal Register - EO 14192](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/05/2025-02349/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation)

#### How It Works in Practice

The 10-for-1 rule creates a mathematical impossibility for environmental regulation:
- Most environmental regulations impose compliance costs on industry (the "cost" side)
- Health and ecological benefits are on the "benefit" side
- Under the net-zero cost cap, EPA cannot issue any regulation that imposes new costs on industry
- To issue one new rule costing industry $100 million, EPA must find 10 existing rules to repeal, and those 10 repeals must generate at least $100 million in cost savings to industry
- In practice, this means EPA can effectively only deregulate, never strengthen protections

#### Impact on EPA

Since January 2025:
- EPA has issued zero new protective environmental regulations
- EPA has initiated proceedings to repeal or weaken approximately 30 existing rules
- New rulemakings addressing emerging contaminants (PFAS, microplastics, new chemicals) have been halted
- Climate-related regulations are explicitly prioritized for repeal

#### Legal Challenges

Several lawsuits challenge the 10-for-1 rule:
- Environmental organizations argue it violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by imposing arbitrary barriers unrelated to statutory mandates
- States argue it prevents EPA from fulfilling its Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act obligations
- Legal scholars argue agencies cannot ignore statutory mandates to protect health simply because of an executive order

### [+] Endangered Species Act Weakening

#### Regulatory Changes

The administration has moved to weaken Endangered Species Act (ESA) implementation:
- **Critical habitat designations** -- New rule limits critical habitat to areas currently occupied by listed species, excluding potential recovery habitat
- **Economic impact analysis required** -- Listing decisions must now include economic impact analysis, which the ESA originally excluded from the listing determination
- **Blanket 4(d) rule eliminated for threatened species** -- Removed automatic extension of "take" protections to species listed as "threatened" (as opposed to "endangered")
- **Consultation streamlined** -- Section 7 consultations between federal agencies and the Fish and Wildlife Service expedited, with 60-day deadlines that critics say are insufficient for complex analyses

[source: Federal Register - ESA Listing and Critical Habitat Regulations](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/11/21/2025-20549/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-listing-endangered-and-threatened-species-and)

#### Species Affected

Species whose protections have been reduced or are under review:
- **Gray wolf** -- Delisted from ESA protection in most of the continental U.S.
- **Grizzly bear** -- Proposed delisting in Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem
- **Northern spotted owl** -- Critical habitat reduced by millions of acres to allow timber harvesting
- **Sage grouse** -- Bureau of Land Management plans rescinding habitat protections
- **Monarch butterfly** -- Listing determination deferred despite 80% population decline
- **Red wolf** -- Recovery program in North Carolina suspended
- **Polar bear** -- Critical habitat in Arctic reduced in conjunction with drilling expansion

#### Habitat Loss

- Over 20 million acres of critical habitat designations under review for potential revocation
- Habitat conservation plans being renegotiated on terms more favorable to developers
- Sage grouse habitat management plans that protected 67 million acres across 11 Western states being rescinded
- National Wildlife Refuge system facing 40% budget cuts

### [+] NEPA and Environmental Review Changes

#### What Is NEPA?

The National Environmental Policy Act (1970) requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of proposed actions before making decisions. NEPA requires:
- **Environmental Impact Statements (EIS)** for major federal actions significantly affecting the environment
- **Environmental Assessments (EA)** for actions with uncertain environmental effects
- **Public comment periods** for affected communities
- **Consideration of alternatives** including the "no action" alternative

[source: Federal Register - NEPA Implementing Regulations Revisions Phase 2](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/05/01/2024-08792/national-environmental-policy-act-implementing-regulations-revisions-phase-2)

#### Changes Under the Current Administration

Executive orders and related directives have:
- Expanded the use of "categorical exclusions" (CATEXs) to bypass environmental review for energy projects, highway construction, and mining
- Shortened EIS timelines from an average of 4.5 years to a 1-year target
- Limited the scope of effects agencies must consider -- excluding indirect and cumulative effects
- Eliminated consideration of climate change impacts in environmental reviews
- Revoked the Biden-era Phase 2 NEPA regulations that restored consideration of cumulative effects and environmental justice
- Reduced public comment periods from 90 to 30 days

**Fiscal Responsibility Act (2023)** provisions being aggressively implemented:
- Page limits on EIS documents (150/300 pages)
- Single lead agency requirement
- 2-year deadline for EIS completion

[source: Federal Register - Removal of NEPA Implementing Regulations](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2026/01/08/2026-00178/removal-of-national-environmental-policy-act-implementing-regulations)

#### Projects Affected

Projects moving forward without full environmental review:
- Oil and gas pipelines on federal lands
- Liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals
- Highway expansion projects
- Mining operations on federal lands
- Logging projects in national forests
- Military base expansions

### [+] Scientific Advisory Boards Dismantled

#### What Was Changed

EPA relies on independent scientific advisory committees to review the science underlying its regulations. The administration has:

**Science Advisory Board (SAB):**
- All existing members' terms expired or were terminated in early 2025
- New appointments include industry consultants and scientists who have received funding from regulated industries
- The requirement that SAB members be free of financial conflicts of interest has been reversed
- Meeting frequency reduced

**Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC):**
- CASAC reviews the scientific basis for National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
- Members who supported tighter PM2.5 and ozone standards were not reappointed
- Replaced with members who have questioned the health science linking particulate matter to premature death

**Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC):**
- Oversees EPA's research programs
- Membership reduced and reconstituted with industry-aligned members
- Several subcommittees dissolved

#### The "Secret Science" Rule

EPA finalized a rule (originally proposed in Trump's first term) requiring that all studies used to support regulations make their underlying data publicly available. While framed as "transparency," critics note:
- Many landmark health studies rely on confidential medical records that cannot be made public due to privacy laws (HIPAA)
- This effectively excludes the Harvard Six Cities Study and the American Cancer Society studies -- the foundational research supporting PM2.5 standards
- The rule was struck down by courts during the Biden administration but has been revived

## Analysis

The current administration has constructed an interlocking system of deregulation that goes beyond simply repealing individual rules. By simultaneously eliminating the economic methodology for justifying regulations (VSL removal), creating mathematical barriers to new rules (10-for-1), gutting the agency's capacity to enforce existing rules (budget and staff cuts), removing independent scientific review (advisory board reconstitution), and fast-tracking extractive projects while eliminating environmental review (NEPA changes), the administration has effectively dismantled the regulatory infrastructure that has protected American public health and environment for over 50 years.

### [+] What This Means

#### Public Health Impacts

The EPA's own analyses, published over decades, document the health benefits of the regulations now being dismantled:

- **Air pollution deaths:** The Clean Air Act prevents an estimated 230,000 premature deaths annually. Rolling back PM2.5 standards, mercury rules, and cross-state pollution rules could reverse a significant portion of these gains.
- **Children's health:** Lead exposure causes irreversible neurological damage. Mercury exposure during pregnancy causes developmental disabilities. Weakening lead, mercury, and PFAS standards exposes millions of children to neurotoxins.
- **Cancer risk:** PFAS chemicals (linked to kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease) contaminate the drinking water of over 100 million Americans. Rolling back the 2024 PFAS standards leaves these communities unprotected.
- **Respiratory illness:** Ozone (smog) and PM2.5 cause asthma attacks, bronchitis, and reduced lung function. Weakening vehicle emission standards and power plant rules increases smog in urban areas.

#### Climate Trajectory

Without federal climate policy:
- U.S. emissions are projected to remain at approximately 5-6 billion metric tons CO2 annually through 2035
- The 1.5 degrees C warming threshold will likely be permanently exceeded within the next decade
- Extreme weather costs are accelerating -- 2024 saw 27 billion-dollar weather disasters in the U.S., a record
- Sea level rise projections for U.S. coasts: 10-12 inches by 2050 under current trajectories
- Agricultural disruption: Shifting growing zones, increased drought, crop yield reductions

#### Intergenerational Harm

The decisions being made now have consequences measured in decades and centuries:
- Carbon dioxide persists in the atmosphere for 300-1,000 years
- Species driven to extinction cannot be recovered
- Contaminated aquifers take decades or centuries to remediate
- Infrastructure built without climate resilience will require costly retrofitting or replacement
- Health effects of childhood lead and PFAS exposure are lifelong and irreversible

### [+] Who's Affected

**Communities near pollution sources:**
- Fence-line communities adjacent to refineries, chemical plants, and power plants face the most immediate health impacts from weakened air quality standards
- These communities are disproportionately Black, Latino, Indigenous, and low-income
- EPA's Environmental Justice programs -- which directed resources to these communities -- have been eliminated

**Rural and Western communities:**
- Public lands constitute 28% of the total U.S. land area and are concentrated in Western states
- Ranchers who depend on public land grazing allotments face disruption from expanded drilling and mining
- Outdoor recreation industry ($862 billion annually) depends on protected public lands and clean water
- Rural communities downstream from mining and drilling operations face water contamination risks

**Coastal communities:**
- Offshore drilling expansion threatens fisheries and tourism economies
- Oil spill risk increases with expanded offshore leasing
- Climate-driven sea level rise and intensified hurricanes threaten coastal infrastructure
- The National Flood Insurance Program already faces insolvency

**Future generations:**
- Climate change impacts compound over time
- Contaminated land and water require decades of cleanup
- Biodiversity loss is irreversible
- Infrastructure decisions lock in energy systems for 30-50 years

**Tribal nations:**
- Sacred sites on federal lands opened to extraction (Bears Ears, ANWR)
- Treaty rights to clean water, fish, and wildlife threatened by deregulation
- Environmental Justice programs that supported Tribal environmental protection eliminated
- Tribal consultation requirements in NEPA being weakened

**Agricultural communities:**
- Pesticide regulation rollbacks increase farmworker exposure risks
- Water quality degradation affects irrigation and livestock
- Climate change shifts growing seasons and increases extreme weather damage
- Pollinator decline (related to pesticide deregulation) threatens crop yields

### [+] The Economic Reality

**Cost of Environmental Protection vs. Cost of Inaction:**

The economic argument for deregulation rests on compliance costs to industry. But the costs of environmental damage consistently exceed the costs of prevention:

| Category | Annual Cost of Prevention | Annual Cost of Inaction |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Clean Air Act compliance | ~$65 billion | ~$2 trillion (health, productivity, premature death) |
| PFAS water treatment | ~$1.5 billion | ~$15-50 billion (healthcare, contamination cleanup) |
| Climate mitigation | ~$200 billion | ~$500 billion-$2 trillion (extreme weather, infrastructure, agriculture) |
| Endangered species protection | ~$1.5 billion | Incalculable (biodiversity collapse, ecosystem services) |

[source: EPA Benefits and Costs of the Clean Air Act, Second Prospective Study](https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/benefits-and-costs-clean-air-act)

**The Clean Air Act alone returns approximately $30 in benefits for every $1 in costs** -- one of the most cost-effective federal programs ever implemented.

**Job Market Claims vs. Reality:**
- The renewable energy sector employs over 3.4 million Americans, compared to approximately 150,000 in coal
- Solar and wind installation are among the fastest-growing job categories in the U.S.
- Environmental compliance creates jobs in monitoring, engineering, and remediation
- Cleanup of contaminated sites (Superfund, brownfields) is a multi-billion dollar industry employing hundreds of thousands

**Property and Insurance:**
- Climate-related property damage: over $90 billion in insured losses in 2024
- Major insurers are withdrawing from climate-vulnerable markets (Florida, California)
- Flood insurance premiums rising sharply under Risk Rating 2.0
- Coastal property values declining as climate risks increase
