### Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton: Age Verification

#### The Ruling

The Supreme Court upheld a Texas law (HB 1181) requiring age verification for websites containing adult content.

**Key Holdings:**
- Applied "intermediate scrutiny" (not strict scrutiny) to the law
- Ruled the burden on adults to verify identity is "incidental" to the state's interest in protecting children
- Rejected arguments that age verification chills anonymous speech

[source: Supreme Court Opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-1122_3e04.pdf)

#### Implications

This ruling provides constitutional approval for states to mandate digital ID verification on internet platforms. While the case involved adult content, the legal reasoning applies broadly:

- States can require identity verification to access online content
- "Protecting children" justifies burdens on adult anonymity
- Third-party age verification vendors will collect identity data

---

## Analysis

### The "Protect the Children" Pattern

A consistent theme connects *Paxton*, *Mahmoud*, and *Skrmetti*: the use of **child protection** as the legal mechanism to restrict broader rights.

| Case | "Child Protection" Claim | Right Restricted |
|------|--------------------------|------------------|
| *Paxton* | Protect minors from adult content | Online anonymity for adults |
| *Mahmoud* | Protect children from conflicting values | Inclusive public education |
| *Skrmetti* | Protect minors from medical decisions | Trans healthcare access |

By framing issues as child safety, courts apply lower scrutiny and permit restrictions that would be unconstitutional if applied to adults directly.

### The End of Online Anonymity

*Paxton* is particularly significant for civic organizing. If states can require ID verification for adult content, the same logic permits:
- ID requirements for social media accounts
- Age-gating on political content deemed "inappropriate"
- Tracking of who accesses what content

This lays groundwork for a "Real ID internet" where dissent can be identified and tracked.

### Who Is Affected

- **Trans youth and families**: Must travel for care or go without
- **LGBTQ+ students**: Face classroom segregation when peers opt out
- **Online activists**: Anonymity protections weakened
- **Privacy advocates**: Age verification creates data collection risks
- **Teachers**: Must navigate complex opt-out logistics
