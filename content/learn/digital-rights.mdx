### Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton: Age Verification

### The Ruling

The Supreme Court upheld a Texas law (HB 1181) requiring age verification for websites containing adult content.

**Key Holdings:**
- Applied "intermediate scrutiny" (not strict scrutiny) to the law
- Ruled the burden on adults to verify identity is "incidental" to the state's interest in protecting children
- Rejected arguments that age verification chills anonymous speech

Source: [Supreme Court Opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-1122_3e04.pdf)

### Implications

This ruling provides constitutional approval for states to mandate digital ID verification on internet platforms. While the case involved adult content, the legal reasoning applies broadly:

- States can require identity verification to access online content
- "Protecting children" justifies burdens on adult anonymity
- Third-party age verification vendors will collect identity data

---

### Mahmoud v. Taylor: Educational Opt-Outs

### The Ruling

The Supreme Court ruled that parents have a constitutional right to opt their elementary school children out of lessons involving LGBTQ+ themes.

**Key Holdings:**
- Parents' religious exercise rights include controlling children's exposure to content conflicting with religious beliefs
- Schools cannot deny opt-out requests for inclusive curriculum
- Overturned lower courts that had rejected parental opt-out demands

Source: [Supreme Court Opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24-297_4f14.pdf)

### Implications

- Individual parents can effectively veto inclusive education for their children
- Schools must create alternative instruction or excuse students
- May require classroom segregation during certain lessons
- Shifts curriculum battles to local school boards

---

### United States v. Skrmetti: Gender-Affirming Care

### The Ruling

The Supreme Court affirmed a Tennessee law (SB1) banning gender-affirming medical care for minors.

**Key Holdings:**
- Such bans are subject only to "rational basis review"—the lowest level of judicial scrutiny
- The law regulates "medical procedures," not sex discrimination
- States have authority to regulate medical treatments for minors

Source: [Congress.gov Summary](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11329)

### Implications

- Effectively ends the federal constitutional argument for trans healthcare rights
- States are free to ban puberty blockers, hormones, and surgeries for minors
- Creates a patchwork where care is available in some states, banned in others
- Families seeking care must travel to "sanctuary states"

---

### TikTok U.S. Resolution

### The Deal

Instead of a total ban, TikTok was restructured as a U.S. joint venture with Oracle and Walmart.

**Structure:**
- ByteDance retains minority stake
- Oracle handles U.S. data storage
- Walmart involved in e-commerce integration
- U.S. government gains oversight of algorithm

Source: [Broadband Breakfast](https://broadbandbreakfast.com/what-to-know-about-the-deal-to-keep-tiktok-from-being-banned-in-the-u-s/)

### Implications

- Primary communication platform for young Americans now under U.S. corporate/government oversight
- Concerns about algorithmic manipulation and political content moderation
- Precedent for government intervention in social media ownership

## Analysis

### The "Protect the Children" Pattern

A consistent theme connects *Paxton*, *Mahmoud*, and *Skrmetti*: the use of **child protection** as the legal mechanism to restrict broader rights.

| Case | "Child Protection" Claim | Right Restricted |
|------|--------------------------|------------------|
| *Paxton* | Protect minors from adult content | Online anonymity for adults |
| *Mahmoud* | Protect children from conflicting values | Inclusive public education |
| *Skrmetti* | Protect minors from medical decisions | Trans healthcare access |

By framing issues as child safety, courts apply lower scrutiny and permit restrictions that would be unconstitutional if applied to adults directly.

### The End of Online Anonymity

*Paxton* is particularly significant for civic organizing. If states can require ID verification for adult content, the same logic permits:
- ID requirements for social media accounts
- Age-gating on political content deemed "inappropriate"
- Tracking of who accesses what content

This lays groundwork for a "Real ID internet" where dissent can be identified and tracked.

### Who Is Affected

- **Trans youth and families**: Must travel for care or go without
- **LGBTQ+ students**: Face classroom segregation when peers opt out
- **Online activists**: Anonymity protections weakened
- **Privacy advocates**: Age verification creates data collection risks
- **Teachers**: Must navigate complex opt-out logistics
