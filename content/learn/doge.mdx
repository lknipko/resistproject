# DOGE: The Dismantling of Federal Government

## Quick Summary

The "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, is an extralegal advisory body that has fired or forced out over 260,000 federal employees, gained access to sensitive Treasury payment systems and personnel databases, and moved to dismantle entire agencies including USAID, the CFPB, and the Department of Education. Multiple federal courts have blocked DOGE actions, finding them likely illegal. The real-world consequences include Social Security processing backlogs, Veterans Affairs healthcare delays, food safety inspection cuts, and the loss of irreplaceable institutional expertise across the government.

## Facts

### Key Points

- **DOGE has no legal authority.** It was established by executive order as an advisory body within the Executive Office of the President, yet it has exercised operational control over agencies, fired employees, and canceled contracts -- powers never granted by Congress. [Source: EO establishing DOGE](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/)

- **Over 260,000 federal employees have been fired, forced to resign, or placed on leave** since DOGE began operations in January 2025. This includes mass terminations of probationary employees across nearly every agency, the "fork in the road" resignation offers, and targeted reductions in force (RIFs).

- **DOGE operatives gained access to Treasury Department payment systems** that process $6 trillion annually, including Social Security, Medicare, and veteran benefit payments -- despite lacking appropriate security clearances. A federal judge temporarily blocked this access. [Source: Court filing, AFL-CIO v. U.S. Treasury](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69631573/american-federation-of-government-employees-afl-cio-v-us-office-of/)

### [+] What Is DOGE?

**Legal Basis**

On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order establishing the "Department of Government Efficiency" as a temporary advisory body within the Executive Office of the President. Despite its name, DOGE is not an actual department of the federal government -- it was not created by Congress, has no statutory authority, no Senate-confirmed leadership, and no independent budget.

[source: Executive Order - Establishing DOGE](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/)

**Elon Musk's Role**

Elon Musk was named as a "Special Government Employee" (SGE) to lead DOGE. SGE status is a designation for part-time advisors that limits their government service to no more than 130 days per year. This designation was significant because:

- SGEs are subject to fewer financial disclosure requirements than full-time employees
- SGEs are exempt from certain ethics rules applying to regular government employees
- Musk's SGE status was challenged in court as improper given his operational role
- A federal court later found that Musk's role exceeded advisory functions

**Structure and Staffing**

DOGE was staffed primarily through:

- **"DOGE Teams"** embedded in each federal agency, typically 4-8 people per agency
- **Technology workers** recruited from Musk's private companies (Tesla, SpaceX, X/Twitter, The Boring Company)
- **Young engineers and programmers**, some reportedly in their late teens and early twenties, given access to government systems
- **No Senate confirmation** for any DOGE leadership or staff
- **Minimal vetting** -- many staff reportedly lacked security clearances appropriate for the systems they accessed

[source: HSGAC DOGE Report on Privacy and Security Violations](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/dems/peters-report-finds-that-doge-continues-to-operate-unchecked-likely-violating-federal-privacy-and-security-laws-and-putting-the-safety-of-americans-personal-information-in-danger/)

**Claimed Mission vs. Actual Actions**

DOGE's stated mission was to identify government waste, fraud, and abuse and recommend spending cuts. However, its actual actions went far beyond advisory recommendations:

- Directly terminating employees
- Canceling contracts and grants
- Shutting down agency operations
- Accessing and modifying payment systems
- Issuing directives to agency heads
- Halting regulatory proceedings

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted that many of these actions would normally require congressional authorization under the Impoundment Control Act.

[source: GAO - Impoundment Control Act](https://www.gao.gov/legal/appropriations-law/impoundment-control-act) | [source: CRS Report - DOGE Executive Order Implementation](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN12493)

---

### [+] Mass Firings & Workforce Reduction

**Phase 1: The "Fork in the Road" Emails (January-February 2025)**

On January 28, 2025, OPM -- under DOGE direction -- sent mass emails to approximately 2 million federal employees offering "deferred resignation." Employees were told they could resign immediately and receive pay and benefits through September 2025. The email was titled "Fork in the Road" and gave employees just days to decide.

- The White House initially claimed 40,000-65,000 employees accepted
- Actual acceptance numbers were later disputed
- A federal judge temporarily blocked the program after unions filed suit
- The program was restarted after the court order expired

[source: OPM Fork in the Road program page](https://www.opm.gov/about-us/fork/original-email-to-employees/) | [source: CRS Legal Analysis of Deferred Resignation](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11277)

**Phase 2: Probationary Employee Purges (February-March 2025)**

DOGE targeted probationary employees -- those with less than one year of service who have fewer civil service protections. Mass firings occurred at:

| Agency | Approximate Employees Fired | Key Functions Lost |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| USAID | 2,200+ | Global health, disaster relief |
| Department of Education | 1,300+ | Student loan servicing, civil rights enforcement |
| EPA | 1,500+ | Environmental enforcement, cleanup |
| HHS | 2,400+ | Public health, drug safety |
| VA | 1,700+ | Veterans healthcare, benefits processing |
| IRS | 7,000+ | Tax processing, fraud enforcement |
| SSA | 3,000+ | Benefits processing, disability claims |
| NOAA | 800+ | Weather forecasting, climate monitoring |
| FDA | 800+ | Food and drug safety inspections |
| Department of Interior | 1,200+ | National parks, tribal services |
| CDC | 700+ | Disease surveillance, outbreak response |
| DOJ | 500+ | Federal law enforcement, civil rights |
| Department of Agriculture | 3,500+ | Food safety, rural development |
| GSA | 1,100+ | Government facilities, technology |
| HUD | 600+ | Housing assistance, fair housing |
| Department of Commerce | 900+ | Census, economic data, trade |

[source: AFGE - Summary of AFGE Lawsuits against Trump & How Litigation Works](https://www.afge.org/article/summary-of-afge-lawsuits-against-trump--how-litigation-works-2/) | [source: AFGE - Court Orders Reinstatement of Fired Employees](https://www.afge.org/publication/federal-court-orders-reinstatement-of-fired-probationary-federal-employees/)

**Phase 3: Reductions in Force (RIFs) (March-April 2025)**

After the probationary employee purges, DOGE moved to formal RIFs -- which require agencies to follow specific legal procedures including 60-day notice periods. Key RIF actions:

- **OPM** directed agencies to identify positions for elimination
- **OMB** issued guidance requiring agencies to reduce headcount by 10-20% within the fiscal year
- Multiple agencies announced office closures and consolidations
- The Department of Education was targeted for complete elimination

[source: OPM-OMB Memo on Agency RIF and Reorganization Plans, February 26, 2025](https://www.opm.gov/chcoc/latest-memos/guidance-on-agency-rif-and-reorganization-plans-requested-by-implementing-the-president-s-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative.pdf)

**Phase 4: The "Return to Office" Mandate**

DOGE also used return-to-office mandates as an attrition tool:

- Ordered all federal employees to return to office 5 days per week
- Set aggressive timelines that were logistically impossible for many agencies
- Many federal offices lacked sufficient desk space for full occupancy
- Employees who could not comply faced termination
- The real purpose, as stated by Musk publicly, was to induce voluntary departures

**Impact on Workforce Demographics**

The firings disproportionately affected:

- **Veterans**: Federal government is the largest employer of veterans; VA and DoD civilian cuts hit veteran employees
- **Disabled workers**: Federal workforce has higher disabled employee representation than private sector
- **Workers in rural areas**: Federal jobs are a major employment source outside major metro areas
- **Mid-career professionals**: Many fired employees had 5-15 years of specialized expertise

### [+] Accessing Sensitive Government Systems

**Treasury Payment Systems**

In late January 2025, DOGE operatives gained access to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service's payment systems at the Treasury Department. These systems process approximately $6 trillion in annual payments including:

- Social Security benefits (70 million recipients)
- Medicare payments
- Veterans benefits
- Military pay
- Tax refunds
- Federal contractor payments

The DOGE team demanded read-and-write access to these systems. Career Treasury officials raised security concerns, and when they resisted, they were reassigned or placed on leave. The AFL-CIO and other unions filed emergency litigation to block access.

**Court Order on Treasury Access**

U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer issued a temporary restraining order in February 2025 limiting DOGE's access to read-only on certain Treasury systems. The court found:

- DOGE staff likely lacked appropriate security clearances
- The access posed risks to personally identifiable information (PII) of millions of Americans
- There was no statutory authorization for DOGE to access payment systems
- The government failed to show DOGE staff had completed required security training

[source: Court order, AFL-CIO et al. v. U.S. Department of the Treasury](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69631573/american-federation-of-government-employees-afl-cio-v-us-office-of/)

**OPM Personnel Records**

DOGE operatives accessed OPM's Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI) system, which contains:

- Personnel records for 2.2 million current federal employees
- Records for millions of former employees and retirees
- Social Security numbers
- Home addresses and phone numbers
- Health insurance and life insurance information
- Performance evaluations
- Security clearance information

Career OPM staff reported that DOGE team members, including individuals in their early twenties with no prior government experience, were given administrator-level access to these systems.

[source: HSGAC - Peters Presses Agency Leaders on DOGE Access](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/dems/peters-presses-agency-leaders-on-doge-access-to-federal-it-systems-and-data-repositories/) | [source: Full HSGAC DOGE Report (PDF)](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/DOGE_REPORT_FINAL_7.pdf)

**Social Security Administration**

DOGE demanded access to SSA databases containing:

- Benefits records for 70+ million recipients
- Disability determination records
- Earnings records tied to Social Security numbers
- Death records used across government

SSA's Acting Commissioner initially resisted providing access, citing Privacy Act restrictions and the sensitivity of the data. The official was subsequently removed from their position.

[source: SSA Acting Commissioner resignation over DOGE data access (The Hill)](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5150499-social-security-chief-resigns-doge-access-data/) | [source: Court blocks DOGE access to SSA data (NPR)](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/18/nx-s1-5369295/doge-data-social-security)

**IRS Tax Data**

Reports indicated DOGE sought access to IRS taxpayer data, which is protected by Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code -- one of the strongest privacy protections in federal law. This section makes unauthorized disclosure of tax return information a federal crime punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment.

[source: 26 U.S.C. Section 6103](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6103)

**Security Clearance Concerns**

Multiple federal officials and security experts raised alarms about:

- DOGE staff accessing classified and sensitive systems without proper clearances
- No evidence of required background investigations for DOGE operatives
- Potential for data exfiltration to Musk's private companies
- Foreign intelligence implications of unsecured access to government databases
- Several DOGE team members were reportedly foreign nationals or had not undergone counterintelligence screening

### [+] Agencies Dismantled or Gutted

#### [+] Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)

The CFPB was created by Congress through the Dodd-Frank Act (2010) in response to the 2008 financial crisis. It protects consumers from predatory lending, credit card fraud, debt collection abuse, and other financial exploitation.

*What DOGE did:*
- Issued a "stand down" order halting all CFPB operations in February 2025
- Suspended all enforcement actions against financial institutions
- Stopped all pending rulemakings including a credit card late fee cap
- Placed most CFPB staff on administrative leave
- Directed remaining staff to "wind down" operations

*What the CFPB was doing before shutdown:*
- Returned $17.5 billion to 200+ million consumers since 2011
- Supervised major banks, credit card companies, and mortgage servicers
- Enforced fair lending laws
- Maintained a consumer complaint database with 4+ million complaints
- Was actively pursuing enforcement actions against companies for illegal junk fees

*Legal challenge:*
A federal court blocked the shutdown, finding that DOGE could not unilaterally close an agency created by Congress. The case was appealed.

#### [+] United States Agency for International Development (USAID)

USAID administers U.S. foreign assistance and development aid, including critical global health programs.

*What DOGE did:*
- Placed over 80% of USAID workforce on administrative leave in February 2025
- Froze all foreign assistance contracts and grants
- Ordered USAID staff to vacate headquarters
- Moved to fold USAID functions into the State Department
- Canceled contracts mid-execution, stranding programs worldwide

*Critical programs disrupted:*
- **PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief)**: Provides antiretroviral treatment to 20+ million people globally; treatment interruptions can cause drug resistance and death
- **Global food security programs**: Feed millions in famine-prone regions
- **Disaster response**: Rapid-response capability for earthquakes, floods, epidemics
- **Democratic governance support**: Election monitoring and anti-corruption programs

*Legal challenge:*
Federal judges issued multiple injunctions ordering USAID employees reinstated and programs resumed. The administration initially defied court orders, leading to contempt proceedings.

### [+] Elon Musk's Conflicts of Interest

**Federal Contracts**

Elon Musk's companies hold billions in federal contracts, creating direct conflicts of interest as DOGE targets the agencies that award and oversee those contracts:

| Company | Agency Relationship | Contract Value | DOGE Action on Agency |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **SpaceX** | NASA, DoD, NRO | $15+ billion in active contracts | NASA workforce reductions |
| **SpaceX** | FAA (launch licensing) | Regulatory oversight | FAA staffing cuts; Musk publicly attacked FAA |
| **Tesla** | NHTSA (safety investigations) | Regulatory oversight | NHTSA staffing reductions |
| **Tesla** | EPA (emissions standards) | Regulatory compliance | EPA enforcement halted |
| **Tesla** | DOE (EV tax credits) | Billions in subsidies | DOE reorganization |
| **Neuralink** | FDA (device approval) | Regulatory review | FDA inspection staff cut |
| **The Boring Company** | DOT, state agencies | Infrastructure contracts | DOT staffing reductions |
| **X (Twitter)** | FTC (consent decree) | Under active oversight | FTC enforcement paused |
| **Starlink** | FCC (spectrum licensing) | Regulatory oversight | FCC staffing affected |

[source: USAspending.gov contract database](https://www.usaspending.gov/)

[source: Federal Procurement Data System](https://www.fpds.gov/)

**Specific Conflict Examples**

- **SpaceX and FAA**: Musk publicly called for eliminating the FAA division that licenses rocket launches -- the same division that had delayed SpaceX launches due to environmental and safety reviews. DOGE subsequently targeted FAA for workforce reductions.

- **Tesla and NHTSA**: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was investigating Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems for multiple fatal crashes. DOGE-directed cuts to NHTSA reduced the agency's capacity to conduct vehicle safety investigations.

- **X/Twitter and FTC**: X was operating under a 2022 FTC consent decree for privacy violations. The FTC's enforcement division was affected by DOGE-related staffing disruptions.

**Financial Interest**

- Musk's personal net worth is directly tied to Tesla stock, SpaceX valuations, and other ventures subject to federal regulation
- Reduced federal oversight of his companies could increase their profitability
- Musk did not fully divest from his companies or place assets in a blind trust before taking the DOGE role
- The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) did not publicly release a conflicts analysis for Musk's SGE appointment

[source: OGE - Ethics Provisions for Special Government Employees](https://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Resources/Summary+of+the+Ethics+Provisions+that+Apply+to+Special+Government+Employees+(SGEs)) | [source: Sen. Schiff Letter to OGE on Musk Conflicts (PDF)](https://www.schiff.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250210-Sen-Schiff-Letter-to-OGE-on-Musk.pdf)

**Ethical and Legal Standards**

Federal ethics law (18 U.S.C. Section 208) prohibits government employees, including SGEs, from participating in matters in which they have a financial interest. Critics and legal scholars argued that virtually every DOGE action touching Musk's companies violated this statute.

### [+] Legal Challenges to DOGE

**Major Lawsuits Filed**

As of early 2026, at least 40 federal lawsuits have been filed challenging DOGE actions. Key cases include:

**1. AFL-CIO et al. v. U.S. Department of the Treasury**
- *Issue*: DOGE access to Treasury payment systems
- *Court*: U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
- *Outcome*: Temporary restraining order issued limiting DOGE access
- *Status*: Ongoing

**2. AFGE v. USAID**
- *Issue*: Mass placement of USAID employees on administrative leave and agency shutdown
- *Court*: U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
- *Outcome*: Injunction ordering employees reinstated
- *Status*: Administration appealed; contempt proceedings initiated for non-compliance

**3. National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) v. Trump**
- *Issue*: "Fork in the Road" resignation program and probationary employee firings
- *Court*: U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
- *Outcome*: Temporary restraining order blocking program
- *Status*: Ongoing

**4. State Attorneys General Coalition v. DOGE**
- *Issue*: Nineteen state attorneys general filed suit arguing DOGE's access to federal systems violated the Privacy Act and the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA)
- *Court*: U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
- *Outcome*: Preliminary injunction on certain data access
- *Status*: Ongoing

**5. CFPB Employees v. OMB (CFPB Shutdown)**
- *Issue*: Unilateral closure of congressionally created agency
- *Court*: U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
- *Outcome*: Court blocked the shutdown, ruling only Congress can close an agency it created
- *Status*: Appealed

**6. Democracy Forward v. OPM**
- *Issue*: DOGE access to OPM personnel records without Privacy Act authorization
- *Court*: U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
- *Outcome*: Court ordered limits on data access
- *Status*: Ongoing

**Key Legal Arguments**

Courts have found DOGE likely violated:

- **Administrative Procedure Act (APA)**: Agency actions must follow notice-and-comment rulemaking; DOGE bypassed this entirely
- **Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA)**: Advisory committees must operate transparently with balanced membership
- **Privacy Act of 1974**: Limits government sharing and access to personal records
- **Impoundment Control Act**: The President cannot refuse to spend money Congress has appropriated

**Pattern of Defiance**

In several cases, the administration initially failed to comply with court orders, leading to:
- Contempt of court proceedings
- Emergency motions by plaintiffs
- Judicial warnings about rule of law
- Heightened judicial scrutiny of subsequent government actions

## Analysis

DOGE represents something fundamentally different from previous government reform efforts. It is not a commission producing recommendations. It is an operational entity, led by the world's richest man, directly executing the dismantlement of federal capacity from within.

### [+] What This Means

**Constitutional Separation of Powers Under Threat**

The U.S. Constitution assigns specific roles: Congress creates agencies, appropriates funds, and sets policy. The President executes the laws Congress passes. The courts interpret the law and check both branches.

DOGE disrupts this framework by:

- **Closing agencies Congress created** -- only Congress has the power to dissolve a federal agency. The President can request that Congress close an agency, but cannot do so unilaterally.
- **Refusing to spend appropriated funds** -- the Impoundment Control Act (1974) was passed specifically to prevent the President from ignoring congressional spending directives. Richard Nixon's impoundments of congressionally appropriated funds led directly to this law.
- **Bypassing Senate confirmation** -- DOGE leadership exercises executive power without Senate confirmation, violating the Appointments Clause.
- **Defying court orders** -- the administration's initial refusal to comply with USAID reinstatement orders struck at the foundation of judicial review.

**The Destruction of Institutional Knowledge**

Federal agencies contain decades of accumulated expertise:

- Scientists who understand how pollution moves through groundwater
- Economists who can model the effects of trade policy
- Engineers who know why specific safety standards exist
- Lawyers who understand the legal history of regulations
- Program managers who know how to distribute benefits efficiently

Once this knowledge leaves, it takes decades to rebuild. Many fired employees had security clearances, specialized training, and irreplaceable field experience. Foreign competitors -- particularly China -- have actively recruited displaced U.S. federal scientists and engineers.

**The Accountability Vacuum**

By gutting inspector general offices, reducing GAO capacity, and removing career compliance staff, DOGE has weakened the very mechanisms that detect waste, fraud, and abuse -- the opposite of its stated mission.

Without adequate inspectors general, oversight committees lack the investigative support to hold agencies accountable. Without career compliance officers, agencies lack internal controls against corruption.

### [+] Who's Affected

**Veterans (18 million)**
- VA healthcare delays and staffing shortages
- Benefits claims processing backlogs
- Mental health service reductions
- Rural VA clinic closures

**Social Security Recipients (70 million)**
- Disability claims backlog exceeding 1 million
- Field office closures and reduced hours
- Phone wait times doubled or tripled
- Retirement benefit processing delays

**Medicare Beneficiaries (65 million)**
- Claims processing delays
- Provider network disruptions
- Reduced fraud enforcement (meaning more scams targeting seniors)

**Student Loan Borrowers (43 million)**
- Loan servicer transition chaos
- Income-driven repayment plan processing delays
- Loss of civil rights enforcement in schools

**Taxpayers (150 million filers)**
- Slower refund processing
- Reduced customer service
- Less enforcement against wealthy tax evaders (IRS estimates $40+ billion revenue loss)

**Food Consumers (330 million)**
- Reduced food safety inspections
- Less oversight of imported food
- Weakened enforcement against food contamination

**Air Travelers (900 million trips/year)**
- Air traffic controller shortages (already critical before DOGE)
- Reduced safety inspections
- Slower aircraft certification

**Rural Communities**
- Federal jobs are disproportionately important in rural areas
- National park closures and reduced services
- USDA rural development program cuts
- Tribal services reductions

**Global Health Beneficiaries (millions)**
- PEPFAR treatment interruptions for 20+ million HIV/AIDS patients
- Vaccine distribution disruptions
- Famine relief program suspensions

### [+] The Connection to Schedule F

DOGE and Schedule F (Executive Order 14171) work as complementary tools to dismantle the professional civil service:

**Schedule F (EO 14171)** strips civil service protections from "policy-influencing" employees, making them fireable at will. [Full analysis on our Schedule F page](/learn/schedule-f)

**DOGE** provides the operational mechanism to actually execute the firings and agency closures.

Together, they create a system where:

1. **Schedule F removes legal protections** -- career employees can no longer challenge politically motivated firings
2. **DOGE identifies targets** -- determines which employees and agencies to eliminate
3. **Return-to-office mandates create attrition** -- force voluntary departures
4. **"Fork in the Road" offers accelerate exits** -- pay people to leave
5. **RIFs formalize the remaining cuts** -- complete the workforce reduction
6. **New hires are political loyalists** -- replacements selected for loyalty, not competence

The end result is a federal workforce that serves the President's political interests rather than the public interest -- a fundamental reversal of the Pendleton Act's merit-based civil service created in 1883.

**Why This Matters for the Next Administration**

Even if a future President reverses these policies, the damage compounds:

- Fired experts will have found other employment and may not return
- Institutional knowledge is gone permanently
- Rebuilt agencies will lack the experience base of their predecessors
- Years of data collection (climate, health, economic) will have gaps
- International credibility and partnerships will take years to restore

### [+] Historical Context

**Previous Government Reform Efforts**

The United States has a long history of government reform commissions:

| Effort | Year | Approach | Outcome |
|--------|------|----------|---------|
| Brownlow Committee | 1937 | Reorganize executive branch | Led to Executive Office of the President |
| Hoover Commissions | 1947, 1953 | Efficiency recommendations | Many recommendations adopted by Congress |
| Grace Commission (PPSS) | 1984 | Private sector efficiency review | Identified $424B in potential savings; few implemented |
| National Performance Review (Gore) | 1993 | "Reinventing Government" | Reduced federal workforce by 300K over 8 years through attrition |
| Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) | 1988-2005 | Close military bases | Bipartisan, Congress-approved process |
| **DOGE (Musk)** | **2025** | **Unilateral executive action** | **Mass firings, agency closures, court battles** |

**What Makes DOGE Different**

Every previous reform effort either:
- Operated through congressional authorization (BRAC)
- Produced recommendations for Congress to act on (Hoover, Grace)
- Worked through existing agency management (Gore/NPR)
- Achieved workforce reduction through attrition, not mass firing

DOGE is unprecedented in:
- Operating without congressional authorization
- Exercising direct operational control over agencies
- Being led by a private citizen with massive financial conflicts of interest
- Mass-terminating employees rather than using attrition
- Defying court orders
- Targeting agencies that regulate the leader's own companies

**The Pendleton Act Context**

The federal civil service system exists because of assassination. In 1881, President James Garfield was shot by Charles Guiteau, a disappointed office-seeker who expected a government appointment. Garfield's death led Congress to pass the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, establishing merit-based hiring and protections from political firing.

For 140 years, this system ensured that federal workers served the public rather than the party in power. DOGE and Schedule F together represent the most significant reversal of this principle since before the Pendleton Act.
