# Election Security: Dismantling the Defenses

## Quick Summary

This page covers **election security infrastructure** — the cyber defenses, foreign interference protections, and threat-sharing systems that protect elections from hacking and foreign manipulation. This is distinct from voter suppression (covered at [Voting Rights](/learn/voting-rights)). Since January 2026, the administration has: defunded EI-ISAC (the election infrastructure threat center); eliminated 130 CISA election security workers and all state/local advisers; disbanded the FBI's foreign influence task force; and frozen Election Assistance Commission grants. State election officials report zero federal communication on election security for months. The 2026 midterms are approaching without the defenses that successfully countered Russian interference in 2024.

## Facts

### Key Points

- **EI-ISAC defunded** (February 2026): The Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center — established after 2016 Russian interference — was completely defunded, terminating real-time threat intelligence to 3,000+ state and local election offices [source: EI-ISAC — Center for Internet Security](https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac)

- **CISA lost 130 election security workers** and all state/local election security advisers — the entire team that worked directly with state and local election officials on cybersecurity [source: CISA — Election Security Resources](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/election-security)

- **FBI Foreign Influence Task Force disbanded** (February 5, 2026): Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the disbanding of the FITF, which had countered Russian, Chinese, and Iranian election interference since 2018 [source: DOJ — FBI FITF Announcement](https://www.justice.gov)

- **78% of state election officials** received zero federal election security communication since December 2025 (National Association of Secretaries of State survey, February 2026) [source: NASS — Election Security Survey](https://www.nass.org)

- **Election Assistance Commission grants frozen** at FY2024 levels; no new security funding allocated for 2026 midterm preparation [source: Election Assistance Commission](https://www.eac.gov)

- **2024 precedent:** Active military cyber operations successfully countered Russian trolls and disinformation in the 2024 election cycle; those programs have been shut down or reassigned

### [+] What Was In Place

#### EI-ISAC (Elections Infrastructure ISAC)

Established in 2018 as a direct response to Russian interference in 2016, EI-ISAC was operated by the nonprofit Center for Internet Security (CIS) with DHS/CISA funding. It provided:

- **Real-time threat feeds:** 24/7 alerts on cyberattacks, phishing campaigns, and infrastructure probing targeting election systems across all 50 states
- **Vulnerability assessments:** Free cybersecurity audits for state and local election offices — over 600 assessments completed by 2024
- **3,000+ members:** Nearly every state election office and most major county election offices were members, creating a unified threat-awareness network
- **Incident response:** Rapid technical assistance when election systems were attacked or compromised
- **2024 election support:** Monitored and responded to 38 significant cyber incidents during the 2024 election cycle without any disruption to vote counting

#### CISA Election Security Division

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's election security team provided:

- **State/local advisers:** 130 workers embedded with state and local officials providing direct technical assistance
- **Risk and Vulnerability Assessments (RVAs):** Comprehensive cybersecurity evaluations of election infrastructure
- **Election Security Tabletop Exercises:** Scenario training for election officials on how to respond to cyberattacks, disinformation, and physical security threats
- **2024 success:** CISA's infrastructure monitoring detected and helped neutralize multiple foreign hacking attempts against voter registration databases

#### FBI Foreign Influence Task Force (FITF)

Established in 2018 after the Mueller investigation, the FITF coordinated:

- **Foreign influence operations:** Tracking Russian, Chinese, Iranian, and other state actor disinformation campaigns targeting U.S. elections
- **Social media platform coordination:** Worked with tech companies to identify and remove coordinated inauthentic behavior (fake accounts operated by foreign governments)
- **Grand jury investigations:** Issued indictments of foreign nationals engaged in election interference (12 Russian intelligence officers, Iranian hackers)
- **2024 operations:** Successfully disrupted multiple Russian influence operations targeting swing-state voters

### [+] What Has Been Eliminated

#### Timeline of Dismantlement

| Date | Action | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2026-01-20 | CISA restructuring announced; election security team scope reduced | State advisers lose federal point of contact |
| 2026-01-31 | CISA election security team of 130 eliminated | No federal technical support for state election officials |
| 2026-02-05 | AG Bondi orders FBI Foreign Influence Task Force disbanded | No federal foreign interference monitoring |
| 2026-02-12 | EI-ISAC funding terminated | 3,000+ election offices lose real-time threat intelligence |
| 2026-02-15 | EAC grants frozen at FY2024 levels | No new security funding for 2026 midterms |
| 2026-02-20 | NASS survey: 78% of state election officials report zero federal contact | Confirmed communications breakdown |

#### What's Still In Place (But Reduced)

- **State-level cybersecurity:** Some states have their own cybersecurity teams; capacity varies dramatically
- **National Guard cyber units:** 50 states have National Guard cyber units; some are pivoting to election security assistance
- **Private sector information sharing:** CISA's broader infrastructure ISAC still operates (just not election-specific)
- **EAC:** Still exists but with frozen grants and reduced staff

### [+] States on Their Own

#### The Patchwork Problem

Election security in the United States is administered by approximately **10,000 local election jurisdictions** across 50 states. Without federal coordination, security is only as strong as the least-resourced jurisdiction.

**The resource disparity:**
- Large states (California, Texas, New York) have cybersecurity budgets and dedicated IT teams
- Rural counties may have a single election administrator who also handles multiple other duties
- A foreign actor targeting a Senate race in a key state does not need to attack the whole country — just the right county

**What state officials are doing:**
- 22 states have contacted their National Guard cyber units for assistance (NAASS, Feb 2026)
- 14 states have requested mutual aid agreements with neighboring states
- Most states are operating on 2024-cycle threat information — outdated for 2026

#### Quote from State Officials

> "We're flying blind. We used to get daily threat briefings. Now we get nothing. We don't know if we're being probed. We don't know what Russia or China is doing. And we have no one to call." — Anonymous Secretary of State, Politico interview, February 2026

### [+] The Threat Landscape

#### What the Threats Actually Are

**Voter registration database attacks:**
- In 2016, Russian GRU units successfully accessed voter registration databases in Illinois and targeted 21 states
- Modern ransomware attacks on election systems have increased 340% since 2020
- Foreign actors probe voter registration systems seeking to delete records, change addresses, or create chaos on Election Day

**Voting equipment vulnerabilities:**
- Most voting equipment runs on outdated software; supply chain security is a documented concern
- While vote tallies themselves are rarely compromised, pre-election infrastructure (databases, communication systems) are vulnerable
- Paper audit trails exist in 43 states but require functioning election administration to use

**Disinformation operations:**
- Social media manipulation targeting specific communities with false information about polling locations, voting requirements, and candidates
- These operations are calibrated by precinct-level voter data and require foreign government resources to execute at scale

**Physical security:**
- Threats and harassment of election workers continue; over 2,000 documented incidents since 2020

### [+] 2026 Midterms Timeline

**The clock:**
- **November 3, 2026** — General election (all 435 House seats, 33 Senate seats, 36 governor races)
- **Spring-Summer 2026** — Primary season begins; election infrastructure must be secured before primaries
- **Current status (February 2026)** — 9 months before election; federal security apparatus dismantled; no replacement announced

**What needs to happen to restore security:**
1. Congress must appropriate new funding for election security (EI-ISAC cannot restart without funding)
2. CISA must rebuild its election security team (hiring and training takes 6-12 months)
3. FBI must restore foreign influence monitoring (institutional knowledge lost when FITF disbanded)
4. EAC must distribute grants to states for equipment updates and training

At the current pace, **none of these will be in place before the 2026 primaries**.

## Analysis

### What This Means

The dismantlement of election security infrastructure is not a partisan choice in the traditional sense — prior to 2025, election security had strong bipartisan support. Senate Republicans championed EI-ISAC funding. The FBI FITF operated under Republican-appointed FBI directors. CISA's election security work was supported by the Trump administration's own DHS during 2017-2021.

What has changed is not a conservative policy disagreement about the role of government — it is a deliberate removal of systems that were working.

### This Is Not Deregulation

Deregulation removes rules that constrain private actors. What is happening here is different: the federal government is removing its own capacity to defend a critical function — democratic elections. The parallel would be decommissioning the Coast Guard while keeping maritime rules on the books. The rules exist but the enforcement and defense capability is gone.

The systems being eliminated were built **because real attacks happened** — in 2016, in 2020, and in every election cycle since. They were not bureaucratic overhead; they were the institutional response to documented vulnerabilities. Their elimination leaves those vulnerabilities unaddressed.

### Who Benefits

The question of who benefits from weaker election security is uncomfortable but important. The historical pattern is clear: foreign interference operations (particularly Russian) have been documented to favor specific partisan outcomes. The 2018 Senate Intelligence Committee report, the Mueller report, and the 2020 bipartisan Senate report all concluded that Russian interference operations attempted to help Trump and harm his opponents in 2016.

Dismantling the systems that countered these operations — while claiming "election integrity" — is a phrase worth examining carefully against the policy record.
