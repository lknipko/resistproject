# Federal Law Enforcement Escalation: The Minneapolis Killings

## Quick Summary

Renee Nicole Good (January 7) and Alex Pretti (January 24) were both killed by federal agents during immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis. Neither was an enforcement target. Both were U.S. citizens.

    Two days before Pretti's death, the House passed H.R. 7147 providing $64.4 billion in DHS funding while rejecting all oversight amendments.

### The Killings

### Renee Nicole Good (January 7, 2026)

**The Victim:**
- 37-year-old U.S. citizen
- Minneapolis resident

**What Happened:**

According to witnesses and video footage, Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed by an ICE officer while attempting to drive away from a confrontation involving ICE agents.

**Official Account (ICE):**
- Claimed Good "weaponized her vehicle"
- Labeled the incident an act of "domestic terrorism"
- Asserted the officer fired in self-defense

**Disputed Account (Mayor Frey, witnesses):**
- Described agents' use of force as "reckless"
- Disputed the characterization of events
- Called for independent investigation

### Alex Pretti (January 24, 2026)

**The Victim:**
- 37-year-old U.S. citizen
- Registered nurse at the VA Health Care System
- Minneapolis resident

**What Happened:**

Less than three weeks after Good's killing, federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti during immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis.

**Circumstances (per video evidence and witness reports):**
- Pretti was attempting to defend a legal observer who had been shoved and sprayed with chemical agents by federal officers
- Pretti was pepper-sprayed and tackled before being shot by an agent
- Pretti was not the target of the enforcement operation

---

### The Pattern: Suppression of Observers

### Tactics Against Non-Targets

The Minneapolis operations have been characterized by aggressive tactics against people who are not enforcement targets:

**Documented tactics:**
- Use of chemical irritants against observers and protesters
- Pepper spray projectiles
- Physical force against individuals recording operations
- Agents operating unmarked or wearing masks

### Fourth Amendment Concerns

The right of citizens to observe and document police activity in public spaces is protected by the First and Fourth Amendments. These tactics raise questions about:
- The legality of dispersing observers
- Use of force against non-targets
- Destruction of evidence by preventing recording

---

### The Funding: H.R. 7147

### DHS Appropriations Act, 2026

Two days before Alex Pretti's killing, the House passed H.R. 7147:

| Provision | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Total DHS Funding** | $64.4 billion |
| **ICE Funding** | ~$10 billion |
| **Detention Beds** | Increased funding |
| **Enforcement Operations** | Increased funding |
| **Oversight Amendments** | Rejected |

**Vote:**
- Passed with support from seven House Democrats
- Democratic amendments to add oversight or limit funding were rejected

### Developments: February–March 2026

#### Operation Metro Surge Ended

Tom Homan announced the formal end of Operation Metro Surge on February 12, 2026, following the two citizen deaths, sustained protests, and growing congressional pressure. Trump concurred with the announcement. The end of Metro Surge does not affect ongoing enforcement operations nationwide.

#### ACLU First Amendment Lawsuit

The ACLU filed a class action in February 2026 alleging DHS violated the First Amendment rights of protesters, journalists, and legal observers during Minneapolis enforcement operations. The suit accuses agents of arresting non-participants without probable cause and using force against people exercising free speech and press rights.

#### Don Lemon Arrest and Charges

Journalist and former CNN anchor **Don Lemon** was arrested in Minneapolis and charged alongside eight co-defendants with unlawful assembly and obstruction of a federal enforcement operation. The charges stem from Lemon following a group of protesters into a church and livestreaming the encounter. Lemon has pleaded not guilty. The case is being watched nationally as a test of press freedom limits during immigration operations.

#### Trump Threatens College Funding Over "Illegal Protests"

President Trump threatened to withdraw federal funding from universities that permit what he characterized as "illegal protests" against immigration enforcement. The threat, made via social media in February 2026, has not been operationalized but has prompted First Amendment concerns from ACLU, FIRE, and the American Association of University Professors.

#### House Judiciary Democrats — First Amendment Hearing

House Judiciary Committee Democrats convened a spotlight hearing on the administration's use of federal agents against journalists and protesters. Republicans boycotted the hearing. Witnesses included two Minneapolis legal observers who had been detained and released without charge.

## Analysis

### What This Means

**The Accountability Vacuum:**

A critical barrier to justice in these cases is the Supreme Court's limitation on *Bivens* actions (lawsuits against federal officials for constitutional violations).

| State Police | Federal Agents |
|--------------|----------------|
| Can be sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 | Near-total immunity from civil damages |
| State/local oversight mechanisms | No equivalent federal statute for ICE |
| Body camera requirements in many jurisdictions | Inconsistent documentation requirements |

Without a specific statute authorizing lawsuits against ICE agents, families of victims have limited legal recourse.

**The Escalation Pattern:**

The two killings within three weeks suggest a shift in rules of engagement:
- Aggressive neutralization of anyone perceived as interfering
- Treating bystanders and observers as threats
- Use of lethal force in situations involving vehicles

**The Political Context:**

The passage of H.R. 7147 two days before Pretti's death—with increased enforcement funding and rejected oversight amendments—signals legislative endorsement of current tactics. The Senate vote on this bill is the next pressure point.

### Who Is Affected

- **U.S. citizens in enforcement zones**: Both victims were American citizens, not enforcement targets
- **Legal observers**: Targeted with chemical agents and force
- **Immigrant communities**: Living under heightened enforcement with militarized tactics
- **Healthcare workers**: Pretti's profession highlights the arbitrary nature of who gets caught in operations
- **Families of victims**: Face near-impossible path to accountability

### The Broader Pattern

These killings occur in the context of:
- Schedule F enabling removal of DHS personnel who might resist aggressive tactics
- *Trump v. CASA* limiting judicial ability to issue broad injunctions against enforcement policies
- Increased funding for enforcement without corresponding oversight
