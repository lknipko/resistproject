# ICE Detention & Mass Deportation

## Quick Summary

Since January 2025, the Trump administration has launched the largest immigration enforcement escalation in modern history. ICE detention has surged past 44,000 people, sensitive location protections for schools, churches, and hospitals have been rescinded, military aircraft are conducting deportation flights, and a legal U.S. resident was wrongfully deported to a Salvadoran mega-prison. Two U.S. citizens have been killed by federal agents during enforcement operations in Minneapolis.

**Scale of Operations:**
- ICE ERO (Enforcement and Removal Operations) arrest numbers surged in 2025
- Operations shifted from targeted enforcement against individuals with criminal convictions to broad sweeps of communities, workplaces, and public spaces
- ICE began publicly celebrating arrest numbers on social media, sharing photographs of detained individuals

[source: ICE — 100 Days of Record-Breaking Immigration Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/100-days-record-breaking-immigration-enforcement-us-interior)

**Deportation Flights:**
- Military C-17 cargo aircraft used for deportation flights — typically reserved for equipment and troop transport
- Deportees shackled for flights lasting 6-12 hours, sometimes without adequate food, water, or restroom access
- Flights to countries including Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, Venezuela, and others
- Some flights to countries that had not formally agreed to accept deportees, causing diplomatic incidents

### [+] Wrongful Deportations & Targeting of Citizens

**Kilmar Abrego Garcia Case (Supreme Court Docket No. 25-1)**

The most prominent wrongful deportation case of this administration:

- **Who:** Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national living legally in the United States with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) since 2001
- **What happened:** He was arrested by ICE during an enforcement operation and deported to El Salvador, where he was placed in the CECOT mega-prison
- **Legal status:** He had active TPS and a valid work authorization. His deportation violated his legal protections.
- **Court intervention:** A federal judge ordered the government to facilitate his return. The government appealed. The case reached the Supreme Court.
- **Supreme Court:** Ordered the administration to "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador. The administration argued it could not control a foreign sovereign's actions.
- **Current status:** Legal battle ongoing over whether the government is complying with the Supreme Court order

[source: Supreme Court of the United States — Docket No. 25-1](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71191591/abrego-garcia-v-noem/)

**U.S. Citizens Detained or Deported:**
- Multiple documented cases of U.S. citizens detained by ICE during enforcement operations
- Citizens held for hours or days while their status was verified
- Reports of citizens pressured to prove their citizenship during field encounters
- The "arrest first, verify later" approach has swept up citizens, green card holders, and visa holders alongside undocumented individuals

[source: ACLU — Know Your Rights: Immigrants' Rights](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/immigrants-rights)

**DACA Recipients:**
- Reports of DACA recipients detained during enforcement operations despite their protected status
- Uncertainty about DACA program's future has created fear among ~600,000 current recipients

[source: National Immigration Law Center — Latest DACA Developments](https://www.nilc.org/resources/latest-daca-developments/)

### [+] Sensitive Location Enforcement

**The Policy Change:**

On January 20, 2025, DHS rescinded the longstanding "sensitive locations" policy that had prohibited immigration enforcement operations at or near:
- Schools and school bus stops
- Churches, synagogues, mosques, and places of worship
- Hospitals and medical facilities
- Courthouses
- Funeral homes and cemeteries
- Domestic violence shelters
- Disaster relief sites

This policy had been in place in various forms since 2011 under the Obama administration and was maintained through both Obama and Biden terms.

[source: DHS Memo — Enforcement Actions in or Near Protected Areas, January 20, 2025](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2025-03/25_0120_S1_enforcement-actions-in-near-protected-areas.pdf)

**Documented Incidents:**

Following the rescission:
- **Schools:** Reports of ICE agents outside schools, leading to attendance drops in immigrant-heavy districts. Some school districts issued guidance telling parents they did not have to open doors to agents without a judicial warrant.
- **Churches:** Documented instances of ICE agents surveilling churches known to provide sanctuary or immigrant services
- **Hospitals:** Reports of immigrants avoiding emergency rooms and prenatal care due to fear of enforcement. Public health officials warned of risks to vaccination rates and disease surveillance.
- **Courthouses:** Domestic violence victims reported being afraid to appear for protective orders. Witnesses in criminal cases stopped cooperating with prosecutors.

[source: U.S. Conference of Mayors & Major Cities Chiefs Association — Joint Statement on Public Safety Amid Federal Immigration Actions](https://www.usmayors.org/2026/01/22/uscm-mcca-join-statement-public-safety/)

**Public Safety Impact:**
- Police departments in major cities warned that rescinding sensitive location protections undermines public safety by destroying trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement
- Crime victims and witnesses refusing to cooperate with local police
- Health departments reporting decreased utilization of public health services

### [+] Family Separations

**Current Family Separation Practices:**

| 2018 "Zero Tolerance" | 2025-2026 Enforcement |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Explicit policy of family separation | No explicit separation policy |
| Separation at the border | Separations occur through interior enforcement |
| Children placed in ORR shelters | Parents detained, children left with remaining parent or placed with family/CPS |
| International condemnation led to EO ending policy | No formal separation policy to reverse |
| Court-ordered reunification (Ms. L v. ICE) | No comparable court order for interior separations |

**How Families Are Separated Now:**
- A parent is arrested during a workplace raid or home enforcement operation while children are at school
- A parent is detained during a traffic stop or routine ICE check-in
- A parent with a final order of removal is deported while U.S.-citizen children remain
- Mixed-status families torn apart without formal "separation" policy

**The Reunification Task Force:**
- The Biden-era Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families was disbanded
- Hundreds of families separated under the 2018 policy remain separated
- No active government effort to reunite remaining separated families

[source: American Academy of Pediatrics — Detention of Immigrant Children Policy Statement](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/139/5/e20170483/38727/Detention-of-Immigrant-Children)

**Impact on Children:**
- U.S.-citizen children of detained or deported parents experience severe psychological trauma
- Studies document increased rates of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and developmental regression
- Children may be placed in foster care if no relative is available
- An estimated 5.1 million U.S.-citizen children have at least one undocumented parent

[source: Urban Institute — Children of Immigrants in 2022-23: National and State Patterns](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/children-immigrants-2022-23)

### [+] Deaths in ICE Custody

ICE is required to publicly report deaths in custody. However, the level of detail and timeliness of reporting has been criticized by oversight organizations.

**Systemic Issues Contributing to Deaths:**
- **Inadequate initial medical screening** — Individuals entering detention often do not receive timely medical evaluation
- **Delayed emergency response** — Reports of hours-long delays between medical emergencies and hospital transport
- **Insufficient mental health care** — Detainees with mental health conditions, including suicidal ideation, receive inadequate monitoring
- **Understaffing** — Medical staff-to-detainee ratios below recommended levels
- **Medication interruption** — Individuals on prescribed medications have those medications interrupted or changed upon entry

[source: DHS Office of Inspector General — ICE Detention Facility Reports](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/reports/audits-inspections-and-evaluations?field_dhs_agency_target_id=3&field_fy_value=All)

**Accountability Gap:**
- Deaths in ICE custody investigated by ICE's own Office of Professional Responsibility — not an independent body
- Families of those who die in custody face near-impossible legal barriers to accountability due to *Bivens* limitations
- No mandatory independent autopsy requirement
- Reporting delays mean some deaths are not publicly known for weeks or months

[source: Freedom for Immigrants — Death in ICE Custody Database](https://www.freedomforimmigrants.org/detention-deaths)

### [+] Militarization of Immigration Enforcement

**Military Border Deployment:**
- Active-duty military personnel deployed to the southern border under the national emergency declaration
- Military personnel performing support functions including surveillance, logistics, and infrastructure
- Legal questions about Posse Comitatus Act restrictions on military performing domestic law enforcement

[source: USNORTHCOM — Additional DoD Units Approved to Deploy to Southern Border](https://www.northcom.mil/Newsroom/Press-Releases/Article/4195643/additional-dod-units-are-approved-to-deploy-to-the-southern-border/)

**Military Deportation Flights:**
- U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft used for deportation flights
- These aircraft are designed for heavy cargo and troop transport, not civilian passenger transport
- Multiple flights per week from military and civilian airfields
- Cost analysis shows military flights significantly more expensive than contracted commercial deportation flights

[source: Witness at the Border — Flight Tracking Data](https://witnessattheborder.org/)

**Guantanamo Bay:**
- Reports the administration considered using the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base facility for immigration detention
- Would place detainees outside normal judicial oversight
- Legal scholars warned this would create a constitutional black hole for immigration detainees

**Surveillance Expansion:**
- Customs and Border Protection deploying drones, surveillance towers, and ground sensors beyond border areas
- Biometric data collection expanded at ports of entry and interior checkpoints
- Data sharing between DHS and other federal agencies expanded under EO 14161

## Analysis

The immigration enforcement escalation since January 2025 represents the most aggressive use of federal law enforcement power against civilian populations in modern American history. It combines unprecedented executive authority claims, military deployment for domestic enforcement, and the systematic dismantling of protections that existed across multiple administrations of both parties.

### [+] What This Means

**Constitutional Crisis:**
The invocation of the Alien Enemies Act — last used for Japanese internment — to bypass individual due process hearings represents a fundamental challenge to the 5th and 14th Amendment guarantees of due process. The government's position is that certain categories of people can be deported without any individual determination of their actual identity, criminal history, or legal status.

**The "Papers Please" Reality:**
With expedited removal expanded nationwide, any person in the United States who cannot immediately prove 2+ years of continuous presence can be deported without seeing a judge. This effectively requires all residents — including citizens — to carry proof of status at all times. U.S. citizens have already been detained during enforcement sweeps.

**Historical Parallels:**
- The Alien Enemies Act was last invoked to intern Japanese Americans — an action the U.S. government formally apologized for and paid reparations
- Mass deportation operations in the 1950s ("Operation Wetback") swept up an estimated 60,000 U.S. citizens along with their targets
- The current scale of operations exceeds any previous peacetime immigration enforcement

**Erosion of Due Process:**
The combination of expedited removal expansion, Alien Enemies Act invocation, and immigration court backlogs of 3+ million cases means that meaningful judicial review is effectively unavailable for many individuals facing deportation.

### [+] Who's Affected

**Directly Impacted:**
- **~11 million undocumented immigrants** in the United States face the threat of detention and deportation without prioritization based on criminal history or community ties
- **~600,000 DACA recipients** face uncertainty about their protected status
- **TPS holders** from multiple countries face potential revocation of their legal status
- **Asylum seekers** face expedited removal before their claims can be heard
- **Mixed-status families** — an estimated 16.7 million people live in a household with at least one undocumented member

**Collateral Impact:**
- **5.1 million U.S.-citizen children** have at least one undocumented parent and face the trauma of family separation
- **Healthcare access** — immigrant communities avoiding hospitals, reducing vaccination rates and disease surveillance
- **Education** — school enrollment drops in immigrant-heavy districts
- **Public safety** — crime witnesses and victims refusing to cooperate with police
- **Agriculture and labor** — industries dependent on immigrant labor face workforce disruption
- **Anyone in an enforcement zone** — as the Minneapolis killings demonstrate, bystanders and U.S. citizens are at risk during operations

### [+] Legal Challenges

**Active Litigation:**
- **Abrego Garcia v. Noem** (Supreme Court Docket 25-1) — Wrongful deportation of TPS holder
- **ACLU v. DHS** — Challenge to expanded expedited removal
- **Multiple Alien Enemies Act challenges** — Courts have issued stays and injunctions in several jurisdictions
- **Birthright citizenship challenges** — Multiple courts blocked EO 14160 (see [Birthright Citizenship page](/learn/birthright-citizenship))
- **Sensitive location challenges** — Various organizations challenging the rescission of protections

**Legal Strategy:**
Since the *CASA* decision limited universal injunctions, legal challenges must be brought in multiple jurisdictions simultaneously. No single court order can protect everyone. This makes organized legal defense critical — and individual participation in lawsuits more important than ever (see [CASA Decision page](/learn/casa-decision)).

**State-Level Resistance:**
Several states have enacted or strengthened sanctuary policies, limiting state and local law enforcement cooperation with ICE. These face federal funding threats but remain legally viable.

### [+] The Broader Pattern

This immigration enforcement escalation does not exist in isolation. It is part of a systematic pattern:

- **Schedule F** ([learn more](/learn/schedule-f)) enables removal of DHS personnel who might resist aggressive tactics or blow the whistle on abuses
- **CASA Decision** ([learn more](/learn/casa-decision)) limits courts' ability to issue broad injunctions, forcing challenges to be fought jurisdiction by jurisdiction
- **H.R. 7147** ([learn more](/act/dhs-funding)) provides $64.4 billion for DHS with zero oversight amendments — funding enforcement while rejecting accountability
- **Birthright Citizenship challenge** ([learn more](/learn/birthright-citizenship)) attempts to create a new category of people without full rights who can be more easily deported
- **DOGE** ([learn more](/learn/doge)) is cutting funding for oversight mechanisms and inspectors general who would investigate enforcement abuses

The immigration enforcement system is being expanded while every accountability mechanism is simultaneously being dismantled.
