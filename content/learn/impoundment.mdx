# Withholding Congressional Funds

## Quick Summary

**Key Point:** The Trump administration has repeatedly refused to spend money that Congress appropriated by law, imposed sweeping funding freezes affecting trillions of dollars in federal grants and loans, threatened to withhold funds from states that resist administration policies, and ignored the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 -- the law specifically designed to prevent presidents from overriding Congress's power of the purse. Multiple courts have blocked these actions, the GAO has found violations of federal law, and a bipartisan constitutional crisis is unfolding over whether the executive branch can simply refuse to execute the budget Congress passed.

## Facts

### Key Points

- On **January 27, 2025**, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum ordering a **freeze on virtually all federal grants, loans, and financial assistance programs**, affecting an estimated **$3 trillion in annual federal spending** across every agency.
- The freeze caused **immediate nationwide chaos**: Medicaid payment portals went offline, Head Start programs stopped receiving funds, Veterans Affairs benefits were disrupted, and states reported being unable to draw down already-approved federal dollars.
- A federal judge issued a **temporary restraining order within 48 hours**, blocking the freeze. The administration initially claimed to rescind the memo, then continued implementing the freeze under different names.
- OMB Director **Russell Vought** directed agencies to conduct line-by-line reviews of all federal spending to identify programs inconsistent with administration priorities, using this review process to **indefinitely delay congressionally appropriated expenditures**.
- The **Government Accountability Office (GAO)** determined that multiple funding pauses and delays constituted illegal impoundments under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, violating federal law.
- The administration **withheld or threatened to withhold federal funds from states and cities** that did not comply with immigration enforcement demands, DEI elimination orders, and other policy directives -- using congressionally appropriated money as leverage.
- As of early 2026, the administration has submitted formal **rescission requests** to Congress under the Impoundment Control Act for billions in appropriated funds, while simultaneously **not waiting for Congress to act** before halting spending -- the exact behavior the Act was designed to prevent.
- Congress has **not enforced** the Impoundment Control Act despite documented violations, creating a constitutional standoff over the separation of powers.

### [+] What Is Impoundment?

**The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 681-688)**

Impoundment is when the President refuses to spend money that Congress has appropriated. The Impoundment Control Act (ICA) was passed in 1974 specifically to prevent this, after President Richard Nixon systematically refused to spend billions that Congress had directed him to spend.

**Why It Was Passed:**

In 1972-1973, President Nixon impounded over $18 billion in funds Congress had appropriated for housing, education, environmental protection, and other programs. Nixon argued the President had inherent authority to decide which laws to fund. Congress disagreed, and the courts sided with Congress. The ICA was passed as part of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 alongside the creation of the Congressional Budget Office.

[source: Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/chapter-17B)

**What the Law Requires:**

The ICA establishes two mechanisms if a President wants to spend less than Congress appropriated:

1. **Deferrals** (temporary delays): The President may temporarily delay spending but must notify Congress through a "special message." Congress can force release of the funds at any time by passing a resolution. Deferrals cannot extend beyond the end of the fiscal year.

2. **Rescissions** (permanent cancellation): If the President wants to permanently cancel appropriated spending, he must send a "rescission request" to Congress. Congress then has **45 legislative days** to approve the rescission. If Congress does not act within 45 days, the President **must** release the funds.

**Critical Legal Requirement:**

Under the ICA, the President cannot simply refuse to spend appropriated money. Even if the President has submitted a rescission request to Congress, the funds must remain available for obligation -- they cannot be withheld while Congress considers the request. Any delay in spending beyond what is necessary for normal program administration constitutes an impoundment requiring a special message to Congress.

[source: GAO Impoundment Primer](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-05-734sp)

**Penalties:**

The ICA gives the Comptroller General (head of the GAO) authority to file suit in federal court to compel release of impounded funds. The Comptroller General can also report violations to Congress. Federal officers who knowingly and willfully violate the Act may face removal from office.

### [+] The Federal Funding Freeze

**OMB Memorandum M-25-13 (January 27, 2025)**

On January 27, 2025, one week after inauguration, OMB Director Russell Vought issued memorandum M-25-13, titled "Temporary Pause of Agency Grant, Loan, and Other Financial Assistance Programs." The memo ordered:

- **All federal agencies** to pause the disbursement of funds under federal financial assistance programs
- The pause was to take effect at **5:00 PM ET on January 27, 2025**
- Agencies were directed to identify programs that may be "implicated by any of the President's Executive Orders"
- Programs related to Medicare, Social Security, and individual entitlement payments were nominally exempted

[source: OMB M-25-13 Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-for-agencies/memoranda/)

**Scope and Scale:**

The freeze applied to an estimated **$3 trillion in annual federal grant and loan spending**, affecting:

- Federal financial assistance to all 50 states, territories, and tribal governments
- Grants administered by every federal department and agency
- Active grants and cooperative agreements already under contract
- New grant awards and pending applications
- Federal loan programs including small business loans, housing assistance, and student loans

**Immediate Impact:**

Within hours of the freeze taking effect:

- **Medicaid**: State Medicaid agencies reported that the federal payment portal (HIGLAS) went offline or rejected payment requests. States could not draw down federal matching funds.
- **Head Start**: Early childhood education programs serving low-income children reported being unable to access funds for payroll and operations.
- **Section 8 Housing**: Housing authorities reported disruptions to rental assistance voucher payments.
- **Veterans Affairs**: Some veterans' benefits payments were delayed.
- **FEMA**: Disaster relief grants to states were frozen.
- **NIH**: Research grant disbursements were halted, threatening ongoing scientific research at universities nationwide.
- **SNAP**: While individual benefits were nominally excluded, state administrative funding for the program was affected.

**The Rescission and Continuation:**

On January 29, 2025, after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, the White House claimed to "rescind" M-25-13. However:

- OMB simultaneously issued new guidance directing agencies to continue reviewing all grants for alignment with executive orders
- Agencies continued to withhold or delay funds under the authority of various executive orders rather than M-25-13
- The practical effect of the freeze continued through different legal mechanisms
- Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the rescission was of "the memo, not the underlying executive orders"

[source: White House Press Briefing, January 29, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/)

### [+] Specific Funds Withheld

The administration withheld or delayed congressionally appropriated funds across multiple agencies. Below are documented instances with available figures:

**U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID):**

- Virtually all USAID foreign assistance programs were frozen beginning January 20, 2025
- An estimated **$60 billion in congressionally appropriated foreign aid** was halted
- USAID was effectively shut down as an operating agency, with employees placed on administrative leave
- Contracts and grants with implementing partners worldwide were stopped mid-execution
- Emergency food aid, HIV/AIDS treatment (PEPFAR), and disaster relief programs disrupted
- A federal judge ordered the administration to continue disbursing funds under existing USAID contracts

[source: Executive Order on Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/30/2025-02091/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid)

**Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):**

- EPA grant programs frozen, including Clean Water State Revolving Fund and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund
- States reported inability to access billions in already-appropriated water infrastructure funding
- Environmental justice grants halted
- Inflation Reduction Act climate and clean energy grant programs paused pending review

[source: EPA Grant Freeze Notices to States, February 2025](https://www.epa.gov/)

**Department of Education:**

- Title I funding for low-income schools delayed
- IDEA (special education) grants reviewed for "DEI content"
- Student loan servicing and forgiveness programs halted (separate from broader policy changes)
- Approximately **$4 billion in school improvement grants** delayed

[source: Department of Education Guidance to States, February 2025](https://www.ed.gov/)

**Department of Health and Human Services (HHS):**

- Community health center grants delayed pending review
- NIH research grants paused -- over **$30 billion in annual research funding** affected
- Head Start program funding disrupted
- Substance abuse and mental health treatment grants frozen
- CDC disease surveillance and preparedness funds delayed

[source: HHS Grant Review Notices, January-February 2025](https://www.hhs.gov/)

**Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD):**

- Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding delayed
- Housing counseling grants frozen
- Homelessness assistance grants reviewed
- Fair housing enforcement funding withheld

**Department of Transportation (DOT):**

- Federal highway and transit formula funds delayed in some states
- Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) discretionary grant awards paused for review
- Electric vehicle charging infrastructure grants frozen

**Department of Justice (DOJ):**

- Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grants withheld from "sanctuary cities"
- Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants delayed
- Byrne Justice Assistance Grants (JAG) funds conditioned on immigration enforcement cooperation

---

### [+] Using Funds as Political Leverage

The administration repeatedly used the threat of withholding congressionally appropriated funds to compel state and local compliance with administration policy priorities:

**Immigration Enforcement Compliance:**

- The administration threatened to withhold federal funding from states and cities that maintained "sanctuary" policies limiting cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities
- Executive Order 14159, "Protecting the American People Against Invasion" (January 20, 2025), directed the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that jurisdictions not cooperating with immigration enforcement "bear the costs of their failures"
- DOJ conditioned Byrne JAG grants (the primary federal law enforcement grant program) on certification of immigration enforcement cooperation
- Multiple cities and states reported threats that federal infrastructure, education, and healthcare funds would be reduced if they did not comply with immigration enforcement demands

[source: Executive Order 14159](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion/)

**DEI Compliance:**

- Executive Order 14173, "Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity" (January 20, 2025), directed agencies to identify federal grant programs that include DEI requirements
- Agencies notified grantees that continued receipt of federal funds was conditioned on certifying elimination of DEI programs
- Universities, hospitals, and state agencies reported being required to sign "anti-DEI certifications" to continue receiving federal research and program funding
- NIH informed researchers that grants would be reviewed for "equity" language and that funding could be withheld if proposals contained DEI-related content

[source: Executive Order 14173](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/)

**State Policy Compliance:**

- The administration signaled that federal highway and infrastructure funds could be conditioned on state cooperation with federal policy priorities beyond what Congress authorized
- Education Department indicated that Title I and IDEA funding could be affected by states' compliance with administration guidance on transgender student policies
- EPA grants conditioned on states' compliance with deregulatory initiatives, even when state environmental standards exceeded (but did not conflict with) federal minimums

**Constitutional Problem:**

When Congress appropriates money for a specific purpose -- education, highway construction, healthcare -- the executive branch is obligated to spend it for that purpose. Using those funds as leverage to compel unrelated policy compliance violates the Spending Clause of the Constitution, which requires that conditions on federal funds be related to the federal interest in the particular program.

The Supreme Court established this principle in *South Dakota v. Dole* (1987) and reinforced it in *NFIB v. Sebelius* (2012), ruling that Congress cannot use federal funds as a "gun to the head" to compel state action on unrelated policies. The same principle applies to the executive branch.

### [+] GAO Findings

The Government Accountability Office (GAO), the nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress, investigated multiple instances of the administration withholding appropriated funds:

**Key GAO Determinations:**

- The GAO determined that OMB's January 27 funding freeze constituted an **illegal impoundment** under the Impoundment Control Act because it withheld funds without submitting the required special message to Congress
- The GAO found that the administration's delay of USAID funds constituted impoundment because the delays extended beyond what was necessary for "programmatic" reasons and were instead motivated by policy disagreements with the programs Congress had funded
- The Comptroller General notified Congress that the administration had failed to comply with the reporting requirements of the ICA
- The GAO documented instances where agencies continued to withhold funds after the nominal rescission of M-25-13, finding that the practical freeze continued through alternative administrative mechanisms

**Historical Context:**

The GAO has monitored impoundment since the ICA was enacted in 1974. While prior administrations have occasionally had technical violations, the scale of the Trump administration's impoundments is unprecedented:

- During the first Trump term (2019), the GAO found that OMB's withholding of $214 million in Ukraine military aid violated the ICA -- the finding that contributed to the first impeachment
- The Biden administration had zero GAO impoundment findings
- The current administration's impoundments affect orders of magnitude more funding across virtually every federal agency

[source: GAO Reports on Impoundment](https://www.gao.gov/topics/budget-and-spending)

**Comptroller General's Authority:**

Under 2 U.S.C. 687, the Comptroller General has the authority to bring a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to compel the release of impounded funds. This authority has rarely been exercised, but the current situation represents the most extensive documented violation of the ICA since its enactment.

[source: 2 U.S.C. 687](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/687)

### [+] Legal Challenges

Multiple federal courts have addressed the administration's funding freezes and impoundments:

**National Council of Nonprofits v. OMB (D.D.C., January 2025)**

- Nonprofit organizations filed suit challenging M-25-13
- U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan issued a **temporary restraining order** on January 29, 2025, blocking the funding freeze
- Judge AliKhan found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, noting the freeze "raises serious constitutional questions" about the separation of powers
- The court found the freeze caused irreparable harm because "organizations that depend on federal funding face imminent closure"
- The administration's claimed rescission of M-25-13 did not moot the case because the freeze continued through other mechanisms

[source: National Council of Nonprofits v. OMB, Case No. 25-cv-239 (D.D.C.)](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69583571/national-council-of-nonprofits-v-office-of-management-and-budget/)

**State Attorneys General Coalition:**

- A coalition of state attorneys general (ultimately over 20 states) filed suit challenging the funding freeze
- States argued the freeze violated the Impoundment Control Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the constitutional separation of powers
- Courts issued preliminary injunctions requiring the release of frozen funds
- The administration appealed, arguing the President has inherent authority to manage executive branch spending

**USAID Litigation:**

- Multiple organizations challenged the freeze of USAID funds
- Federal courts ordered the administration to continue disbursing funds under existing contracts and grants
- The administration was held in contempt in at least one case for failing to comply with court orders to release funds
- Global health organizations reported patients dying as HIV/AIDS treatment and emergency food supplies were cut off

**New York v. Trump (S.D.N.Y., 2025):**

- New York and other states challenged the withholding of federal funds conditioned on immigration enforcement compliance
- The court found the administration's conditions on federal funds were not authorized by Congress and violated the Spending Clause
- Preliminary injunction issued blocking the withholding of funds from sanctuary jurisdictions

**Key Legal Arguments:**

The administration has advanced several legal theories:

1. **Article II Authority**: The President has inherent constitutional authority to manage how the executive branch spends money
2. **Executive Orders as Authority**: Executive orders directing policy changes provide independent authority to pause spending that conflicts with those orders
3. **Programmatic Delays**: The freezes were merely routine "programmatic" delays necessary for agencies to review programs, not impoundments subject to the ICA
4. **Rescission Authority**: The President's rescission proposals to Congress authorized the delay of funds pending congressional action

Courts have largely rejected these arguments, finding:

1. Congress's power of the purse under Article I, Section 9 is exclusive -- the President must spend what Congress appropriates
2. Executive orders cannot override statutes, including appropriations laws
3. The scope and duration of the freezes exceeded any reasonable "programmatic" justification
4. The ICA specifically prohibits withholding funds while rescission requests are pending before Congress

---

### [+] The Impoundment Power Debate

In February 2025, President Trump publicly called on Congress to "give the President back the impoundment power," arguing that the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional and that the President should have the authority to refuse to spend money Congress appropriates.

**The Administration's Legal Theory:**

Russell Vought, both before and after becoming OMB Director, has argued through the Center for Renewing America that:

- The Impoundment Control Act unconstitutionally constrains the President's Article II authority
- The President has inherent executive power to decline to spend appropriated funds
- The ICA was a congressional overreach in response to Nixon
- The Supreme Court has never directly ruled on the constitutionality of the ICA

**The Constitutional Counter-Argument:**

Constitutional scholars across the political spectrum have argued:

- Article I, Section 9 states: "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law" -- this grants Congress exclusive control over spending
- The "Take Care" clause of Article II requires the President to "faithfully execute" the laws, including appropriations laws
- The 1975 case *Train v. City of New York* (420 U.S. 35) held that a President cannot refuse to spend funds Congress directed him to spend under the Clean Water Act
- The Framers intentionally gave Congress the power of the purse as a check on executive power, modeled on Parliament's authority over the English Crown

[source: Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35 (1975)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/420/35/)

**Congressional Response:**

Some members of Congress have introduced legislation to:

- Strengthen the Impoundment Control Act by adding automatic penalties for violations
- Give Congress standing to sue the executive branch for impoundment violations
- Create expedited judicial review for impoundment disputes

However, as of early 2026, no legislation has been enacted, and congressional leadership has not taken action to enforce existing law against the administration's documented violations.

### [+] Impact on States and Programs

The funding freezes and impoundments have had tangible, documented effects on state budgets and public services:

**Healthcare:**
- States reported Medicaid portal outages lasting hours to days during the January 2025 freeze
- Community health centers in rural areas reported delayed grant disbursements threatening clinic closures
- Mental health and substance abuse treatment programs lost continuity of funding
- NIH-funded clinical trials at university hospitals faced interruption

**Education:**
- Title I schools (serving low-income students) experienced delayed funding at the start of semesters
- Special education (IDEA) grants were delayed, affecting services for children with disabilities
- Head Start programs in multiple states temporarily suspended operations
- University research programs faced hiring freezes due to uncertain federal grant status

**Infrastructure:**
- State transportation departments reported delays in accessing federal highway formula funds
- Water infrastructure projects funded under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law experienced disbursement delays
- Broadband deployment grants paused pending review
- Electric vehicle infrastructure funding frozen

**Public Safety:**
- COPS grants to local police departments withheld from jurisdictions not cooperating with immigration enforcement
- VAWA grants for domestic violence shelters delayed
- FEMA disaster preparedness grants frozen, affecting state emergency management

**Scientific Research:**
- Over 1,000 NIH-funded research projects reported funding disruptions
- Climate research at NOAA, NASA, and EPA halted or delayed
- CDC disease surveillance programs affected
- Agricultural research at USDA land-grant universities disrupted

**State Budgets:**
- States that rely heavily on federal funding (often rural, Republican-led states) were disproportionately affected
- State budget offices reported inability to plan due to uncertainty about federal fund availability
- Some states drew on reserve funds to cover programs usually federally funded
- Several states reported considering litigation to recover delayed federal funds

## Analysis

The withholding of congressionally appropriated funds represents one of the most significant separation of powers conflicts since Watergate. The core question is simple but profound: **Can the President refuse to execute the laws Congress passed?**

### [+] The Constitutional Crisis

**The Power of the Purse:**

The Framers of the Constitution gave Congress the exclusive power to appropriate funds (Article I, Section 9) for a specific reason: to prevent the executive from becoming a king. The ability to control government spending is the most powerful check Congress has on the President. When the President can simply refuse to spend money Congress directed him to spend, that check is eliminated.

This is not a partisan issue. The Impoundment Control Act was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support (401-6 in the House) after Nixon demonstrated the danger of allowing a President to unilaterally override spending decisions. Republican Senator Sam Ervin, who chaired the Watergate Committee, was one of the Act's strongest advocates.

**The Precedent Being Set:**

If the current administration successfully establishes that the President can:
1. Refuse to spend appropriated funds
2. Condition spending on compliance with executive policy preferences
3. Ignore court orders to release frozen funds
4. Treat the Impoundment Control Act as unconstitutional without a court ruling

...then every future President -- of any party -- will have the power to effectively nullify any law by refusing to fund it. A future Democratic President could refuse to fund the military. A future Republican President could refuse to fund Medicare. The power of the purse would transfer from Congress to the President permanently.

**Comparison to Nixon:**

Nixon's impoundments, which triggered the ICA, were large for their time ($18 billion) but targeted specific programs. The current administration's approach is qualitatively different:

- **Scope**: Nixon targeted specific programs; the current freeze covered virtually all federal financial assistance
- **Method**: Nixon openly impounded funds; the current administration uses rolling freezes, reviews, and conditions to achieve the same result while claiming not to impound
- **Defiance**: Nixon backed down after losing in court; the current administration has been slow to comply with court orders and continued freezes through alternative mechanisms
- **Legal Theory**: Nixon claimed statutory authority; the current administration claims the ICA itself is unconstitutional, challenging the very legitimacy of the law

### [+] Who Is Affected

- **States and local governments**: Every state depends on federal funds for Medicaid, education, transportation, and public safety. Disruptions in federal funding create budget crises at the state level. Ironically, states that rely most heavily on federal funds tend to be rural, Republican-leaning states.

- **Healthcare recipients**: Medicaid enrollees (over 90 million Americans), patients in community health centers, veterans relying on VA benefits, and people receiving mental health and substance abuse treatment all face service disruptions when funding is delayed.

- **Students and schools**: Title I schools serving low-income students, children with disabilities receiving services under IDEA, Head Start participants, and university researchers all depend on timely federal funding.

- **Scientific research**: The United States' global leadership in scientific research depends on NIH, NSF, NOAA, NASA, and other agency funding. Research interrupted by funding freezes may take years to restart.

- **Infrastructure**: Roads, bridges, water systems, broadband deployment, and public transit projects depend on federal funding that was delayed or frozen.

- **The constitutional order itself**: If Congress allows the President to override its spending decisions without consequence, the balance of power shifts permanently toward the executive branch, regardless of which party controls it.

### [+] The Bigger Picture

**Pattern of Executive Overreach:**

The impoundment crisis does not exist in isolation. It is part of a broader pattern of the administration asserting executive authority over functions the Constitution assigns to Congress or the courts:

- **Schedule F** (Executive Order 14171) strips civil service protections, enabling the President to fire career officials who implement laws the administration dislikes. [Learn more](/learn/schedule-f)
- **DOGE** (Department of Government Efficiency) has accessed agency systems and directed spending cuts without congressional authorization
- **Agency shutdowns**: USAID, CFPB, and other agencies have been effectively shut down through administrative action, despite Congress having funded them
- **Defiance of court orders**: The administration has been slow to comply with court orders requiring the release of frozen funds, and in some cases has been held in contempt

**The Common Thread:**

All of these actions share a single premise: that the President has the authority to decide which laws to enforce, which agencies to fund, and which court orders to obey. This premise, if accepted, transforms the constitutional system of checks and balances into a system where the President's preferences override all other branches of government.

**Bipartisan Stakes:**

Conservative constitutionalists and liberal advocates have both raised alarms about the impoundment crisis because the principle at stake transcends partisan policy preferences. The question is not whether the programs being defunded are good policy -- it is whether the President can unilaterally override Congress's decisions about how to spend the people's money.

Former Republican members of Congress, conservative legal scholars, and libertarian organizations have argued that the administration's impoundments violate both the law and conservative principles of limited executive power and congressional prerogative. The issue unites those who believe in the constitutional structure regardless of which party benefits from that structure in any given moment.
