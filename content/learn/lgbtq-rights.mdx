# Anti-LGBTQ+ Policies

## Quick Summary

Since January 2025, the Trump administration has issued executive orders redefining sex as strictly binary and immutable, reinstated the transgender military service ban, rolled back Title IX protections for transgender students, restricted access to gender-affirming healthcare, removed LGBTQ+ protections for federal employees and contractors, and eliminated non-binary gender markers on federal identity documents. Combined with the Supreme Court's decision in *United States v. Skrmetti* allowing states to ban gender-affirming care for minors, these actions represent the most comprehensive federal assault on LGBTQ+ rights in decades.

[source: Executive Order 14168 Full Text](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/)

Published in the Federal Register: 90 FR 8615 (January 30, 2025)

#### Executive Order 14173: Ending DEI Programs

Signed January 20, 2025, this order dismantles diversity, equity, and inclusion programs across the federal government:

- Revokes Executive Order 11246 (1965), which prohibited federal contractors from discrimination based on sex and other protected categories
- Directs agencies to identify and eliminate DEI-related training programs
- Removes LGBTQ+ specific protections embedded in DEI frameworks

[source: Executive Order 14173 Full Text](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/)

---

### [+] Transgender Military Ban

#### Executive Order 14175: "Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness"

Signed January 27, 2025, this order reinstates the ban on transgender service members:

**Policy Details:**
- Transgender individuals are prohibited from enlisting in the armed forces
- Currently serving transgender service members face separation or forced detransition
- The order frames transgender service as "incompatible with military readiness"
- The Department of Defense was directed to implement the ban within 60 days

- Service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria are deemed "non-deployable"
- Previously approved medical transitions were halted mid-treatment
- Service members given the choice to detransition or separate from the military

**Affected Personnel:**
- An estimated 15,000 transgender individuals were serving openly in the U.S. military under Biden-era policy
- Thousands of service members who had begun medical transitions face disrupted care
- Transgender veterans' VA healthcare benefits for gender-affirming care are under review

[source: Executive Order 14175 Full Text](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/prioritizing-military-excellence-and-readiness/)

**Historical Context:**
- Trump first announced a transgender military ban via Twitter in July 2017
- The first ban was partially implemented in 2019 after the Supreme Court allowed it to take effect (*Trump v. Karnoski*)

### [+] Title IX Rollbacks

#### Reversal of Biden Title IX Regulations

The Biden administration issued final Title IX regulations in April 2024 that explicitly protected students from discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. The Trump administration has reversed these protections:

**What Changed:**
- Biden's April 2024 rule extended Title IX's sex discrimination protections to cover gender identity
- The Trump administration rescinded the Biden rule effective immediately upon taking office
- The Department of Education issued guidance stating Title IX does not cover gender identity discrimination
- Schools are no longer required to allow transgender students to use facilities matching their gender identity

**Specific Policy Reversals:**
- **Bathrooms and locker rooms:** Schools may (and are encouraged to) require students to use facilities matching their sex assigned at birth
- **Athletics:** EO 14187 specifically directs the withdrawal of federal funding from schools allowing transgender girls in female sports
- **Pronouns and names:** Federal guidance no longer requires schools to respect students' chosen names and pronouns
- **Harassment protections:** Misgendering and refusal to acknowledge gender identity no longer constitute harassment under Title IX

**Department of Education Enforcement:**
- The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has been directed to close pending complaints alleging gender identity discrimination
- New complaints based on gender identity discrimination are being rejected
- OCR is redirecting resources to investigate alleged "unfairness" to cisgender female athletes

[source: Department of Education Title IX](https://www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/civil-rights-laws/sex-discrimination/title-ix)

**Impact on Students:**
- Transgender students in hostile school environments lose federal recourse
- Schools in conservative districts face no federal pressure to maintain protections
- LGBTQ+ student groups face potential loss of recognition and meeting space
- Rates of bullying and harassment of LGBTQ+ students expected to increase without federal backstop

[source: GLSEN National School Climate Survey](https://www.glsen.org/research/school-climate-survey)

### [+] Healthcare Access Restrictions

#### Federal Restrictions on Gender-Affirming Care

**HHS Section 1557 Rollback:**
- The Department of Health and Human Services issued a proposed rule removing gender identity from the nondiscrimination protections of Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act
- Under the Biden administration, Section 1557 prohibited healthcare providers and insurers from discriminating based on gender identity
- The new rule allows providers to refuse gender-affirming care on religious or moral grounds
- Insurers may exclude coverage for hormone therapy, puberty blockers, and surgical procedures related to gender transition

[source: HHS Section 1557 Rulemaking](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/section-1557/index.html)

**Medicare and Medicaid:**
- CMS issued guidance allowing states to exclude gender-affirming care from Medicaid coverage
- Medicare coverage determinations for gender-affirming procedures are under review
- Several states have already moved to eliminate Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care

**Impact of *United States v. Skrmetti*:**
- The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming medical treatments for minors does not violate the Equal Protection Clause
- The Court applied rational basis review rather than heightened scrutiny
- Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, held the law regulates "medical procedures, not sex"
- States are free to prohibit puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for minors seeking gender transition
- The decision does not address adult access, but provides legal framework states could extend

[source: United States v. Skrmetti, 603 U.S. ___](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11329)

**State-Level Bans on Youth Gender-Affirming Care:**

As of early 2026, at least 26 states have enacted laws banning or severely restricting gender-affirming care for minors:

- **Complete bans** (prohibit puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery): Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wyoming
- **Partial restrictions** (limit some treatments): Arizona, New Hampshire, Virginia
- **Under consideration:** Several additional states with active legislation

[source: Movement Advancement Project Equality Maps](https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps)

**Impact on Families:**
- Families in ban states must travel to "sanctuary states" (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington) for care
- Some sanctuary states have enacted "shield laws" protecting providers who treat out-of-state patients
- Travel costs, insurance complications, and disrupted care create significant health risks
- Reports of increased mental health crises among transgender youth in ban states

### [+] Federal Employment Protections

#### Removal of LGBTQ+ Workplace Protections

**Executive Order 14173 (DEI Elimination):**
- Revoked Executive Order 11246 (signed by President Johnson in 1965), which prohibited federal contractors from employment discrimination
- Eliminated the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs' enforcement of LGBTQ+ nondiscrimination requirements
- Federal contractors are no longer required to have LGBTQ+ nondiscrimination policies
- DEI training programs that addressed LGBTQ+ inclusion have been terminated

[source: Executive Order 14173](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/)

**Impact on Federal Workforce:**
- An estimated 1 million+ federal employees identified as LGBTQ+ under previous anonymous surveys
- Employee resource groups (ERGs) for LGBTQ+ federal workers have been disbanded
- References to sexual orientation and gender identity removed from agency nondiscrimination statements
- Federal agencies instructed to remove rainbow flags and LGBTQ+ Pride materials from government buildings

**Note on *Bostock v. Clayton County* (2020):**
- The Supreme Court's 2020 ruling that Title VII prohibits employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity remains in effect
- However, the EEOC under the current administration has deprioritized enforcement of LGBTQ+ discrimination claims
- The practical gap between legal protection and enforcement willingness is significant

[source: Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf)

### [+] Identity Documents and Federal Records

#### Passport Gender Markers

**State Department Actions:**
- The Biden-era "X" gender marker option on U.S. passports (introduced March 2022) has been eliminated
- Passports are issued only with "M" (male) or "F" (female) designations
- The State Department requires that passport gender markers match "biological sex"
- Transgender individuals whose existing passports list a gender different from their sex assigned at birth may face renewal difficulties

**Social Security Administration:**
- SSA policy under EO 14168 requires sex records to reflect "biological sex"
- Self-attestation for gender marker changes (implemented under Biden) has been reversed
- Transgender individuals must provide medical documentation to change SSA records, and changes must align with the binary definition

**Federal Bureau of Prisons:**
- Transgender inmates are being reclassified and transferred to facilities matching their sex assigned at birth
- Previously approved hormone therapy for federal prisoners has been discontinued
- The Bureau issued updated guidance in February 2025 implementing EO 14168

**TSA and Travel:**
- TSA screening procedures updated to match gender on ID to "biological sex" appearance

### [+] State-Level Cascade

#### Federal Policy Enabling State Action

The combination of federal executive orders and the *Skrmetti* decision has accelerated state-level anti-LGBTQ+ legislation:

**Anti-Trans Legislation (2025-2026):**
- Over 600 anti-trans bills introduced across state legislatures in 2025 alone
- Bills target healthcare access, bathroom usage, sports participation, identity documents, and drag performances
- Multiple states have passed laws requiring schools to "out" transgender students to parents
- Several states have enacted laws restricting the display of LGBTQ+ content in public libraries

**"Religious Freedom" Laws:**
- States have expanded religious exemptions allowing discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals in:
  - Adoption and foster care placements
  - Healthcare provision
  - Public accommodations (restaurants, hotels, stores)
  - Wedding-related services

**Parental Rights Laws:**
- Following *Mahmoud v. Taylor*, states have enacted laws requiring:
  - Schools to notify parents before discussing LGBTQ+ topics
  - Parental consent for students to use different names or pronouns
  - Removal of books with LGBTQ+ themes from school libraries

**Sanctuary States:**
- In contrast, protective states have strengthened LGBTQ+ protections:
  - California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, and others have passed shield laws protecting access to gender-affirming care
  - Some states have passed laws refusing to enforce out-of-state warrants for gender-affirming care providers
  - Several states have added gender identity to state civil rights statutes

### [+] Legal Challenges

#### Active Litigation

**Federal Executive Order Challenges:**
- Multiple lawsuits have been filed challenging EO 14168 (gender definition) on equal protection and due process grounds
- The ACLU, Lambda Legal, and NCLR have filed coordinated challenges in multiple federal circuits
- Preliminary injunctions have been sought but face an uphill battle after *Skrmetti*'s rational basis framework

**Key Cases:**
- ***Doe v. Trump*** (D.D.C.) - Challenge to EO 14168 by federal employees and military members
- ***Lambda Legal v. Department of Education*** - Challenge to Title IX rollbacks affecting transgender students
- ***Boe v. Marshall*** (11th Cir.) - Challenge to Alabama's ban on gender-affirming care for minors (post-*Skrmetti* remand)
- ***Dekker v. Weida*** (N.D. Fla.) - Challenge to Florida's restrictions on adult gender-affirming care under Medicaid
- ***Noe v. Parson*** (W.D. Mo.) - Challenge to Missouri's restrictions on gender-affirming care

**Legal Strategies Post-*Skrmetti*:**
- Advocates are pursuing state constitutional claims, which may provide stronger protections than federal equal protection
- First Amendment challenges to forced speech (requiring misgendering) are being developed
- Due process liberty interest arguments are being tested for adult healthcare access
- Some cases argue that specific state implementations are irrational even under rational basis review
- International human rights law arguments are being introduced

**Congressional Action:**
- The Equality Act (H.R. 15 / S. 5), which would add sexual orientation and gender identity to federal civil rights law, has been reintroduced but faces no path forward in the current Congress
- Republicans have introduced the "Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act" to codify the transgender sports ban

## Analysis

The scope of anti-LGBTQ+ federal action since January 2025 is unprecedented. Multiple executive orders, agency reversals, and a landmark Supreme Court decision have converged to dismantle protections built over two decades. The strategy is systematic: redefine sex to exclude transgender identity at the federal level, withdraw enforcement of existing protections, and provide legal cover for states to restrict rights further.

### [+] What This Means

**Constitutional Framework Shift:**

The *Skrmetti* decision fundamentally changed the constitutional landscape for LGBTQ+ rights. By applying rational basis review to sex-based classifications in healthcare, the Court signaled that laws targeting transgender people do not receive the heightened scrutiny normally applied to sex discrimination. This contradicts the logic of *Bostock v. Clayton County* (2020), where the Court held that discrimination against transgender people *is* sex discrimination under Title VII.

The tension between *Bostock* (employment) and *Skrmetti* (healthcare) creates legal uncertainty. *Bostock* relied on statutory interpretation of Title VII, while *Skrmetti* addressed constitutional equal protection. The administration argues these are compatible; advocates argue they are contradictory.

**Erasure of Federal Recognition:**

EO 14168's binary sex definition goes beyond policy preference. By defining sex as "immutable" and "determined at conception," the federal government effectively denies the existence of transgender identity as a legitimate basis for any federal policy, program, or protection. This has cascading effects across:

- Civil rights enforcement
- Healthcare access and insurance coverage
- Military service eligibility
- Prison and detention facility placement
- Identity documents and federal records
- Data collection and research funding

**Chilling Effect:**

Even where legal protections technically remain (such as *Bostock*'s Title VII protections), the combination of hostile enforcement posture and administrative barriers creates a chilling effect. LGBTQ+ individuals may not file complaints, seek care, or assert their rights out of fear of drawing attention from a hostile federal government.

### [+] Who's Affected

- **Transgender Americans**: An estimated 1.6 million Americans identify as transgender (Williams Institute, UCLA). They face the most direct impacts: loss of federal recognition, restricted healthcare, military service bars, identity document problems, and increased state-level discrimination.

- **Transgender Youth**: Approximately 300,000 youth ages 13-17 identify as transgender. They face bans on gender-affirming care in 26+ states, loss of school protections, forced outing policies, and sports participation bans. The Trevor Project reports 41% of LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered suicide in the past year.

- **LGBTQ+ Military Members**: An estimated 15,000 transgender service members and thousands more LGB service members face a hostile command climate. Transgender members face discharge or forced detransition.

- **LGBTQ+ Federal Employees**: Over 1 million LGBTQ+ federal employees have lost DEI protections, employee resource groups, and visible institutional support. While *Bostock* protections remain, enforcement is minimal.

- **LGBTQ+ Students**: 1.8 million LGBTQ+ students ages 13-21 (GLSEN) face hostile school environments without federal Title IX protections. Transgender students face bathroom restrictions, sports bans, forced outing, and name/pronoun policies.

- **LGBTQ+ Families**: Same-sex parents, families with transgender members, and LGBTQ+ foster/adoptive parents face discrimination in adoption, healthcare, school enrollment, and federal benefits.

- **Healthcare Providers**: Doctors, nurses, and mental health professionals who provide gender-affirming care face legal risk in ban states. Some have relocated to sanctuary states; others have stopped providing care entirely.

### [+] The Legal Landscape After Skrmetti

**What *Skrmetti* Decided:**

The Court held that Tennessee's SB1, which prohibits puberty blockers, hormones, and surgeries for gender transition in minors, does not violate the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The majority reasoned that the law regulates medical procedures, not sex, and applied rational basis review (the lowest standard of judicial scrutiny).

**What This Means for Future Cases:**

- **State bans are presumptively constitutional.** Courts will uphold bans on youth gender-affirming care unless challengers can show no rational basis -- an extremely difficult burden.

- **Heightened scrutiny is off the table.** The LGBTQ+ rights movement's long-term goal of establishing transgender people as a suspect or quasi-suspect class (triggering strict or intermediate scrutiny) has been set back significantly.

- **Adult healthcare is the next battleground.** *Skrmetti* addressed only minors, but the rational basis framework could be extended to adult care. Several states have already proposed or enacted restrictions on adult gender-affirming care.

- **State constitutions become critical.** Some state constitutions provide stronger equal protection guarantees than the federal Constitution. Litigation under state law may succeed where federal claims fail. Montana's constitution, for example, explicitly protects "individual dignity," which may provide grounds for challenging healthcare bans.

- **International law offers limited leverage.** The UN Human Rights Committee and other international bodies have recognized gender-affirming care as a human right, but these norms have limited direct legal force in U.S. courts.

**The Patchwork Problem:**

The United States now has a geographic patchwork where LGBTQ+ rights depend entirely on location:

- **Protective states** (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and others): Strong state-level protections, shield laws, sanctuary policies
- **Hostile states** (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wyoming): Comprehensive restrictions on trans rights, healthcare bans, hostile school policies
- **Uncertain states**: No clear position, policies vary by locality

This patchwork forces transgender Americans to make geographic decisions about healthcare, employment, education, and safety based on state law rather than federal constitutional guarantees.
