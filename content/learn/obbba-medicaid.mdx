## Facts

### What the Law Does

**1. Medicaid Financing Changes**

The Act prohibits states from using provider taxes to finance their share of Medicaid spending.

> States have historically used taxes on hospitals, nursing homes, and care facilities to generate revenue matched by federal funds. This mechanism is now banned.

[source: Morgan Lewis Analysis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2025/07/one-big-beautiful-bill-act-key-final-medicaid-changes-explained)

**2. Eligibility Requirements**

- **Work requirements** added for Medicaid eligibility
- **6-month reverification cycle** mandated (previously 12 months in most states)

**3. "Prohibited Entities" Provision (Section 71113)**

Federal Medicaid funds cannot flow to entities that:
- Received more than $800,000 in Medicaid payments in FY 2023
- Are primarily engaged in reproductive health services

This effectively targets organizations like Planned Parenthood.

**4. SNAP (Food Stamps) Changes**

Section 10001 prohibits USDA from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) based on re-evaluations. Benefits are frozen to CPI-based inflation adjustments only, decoupled from actual nutritional science.

- Expanded work requirements for "Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents" (ABAWDs)

[source: Congress.gov - Title I](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text/eh)

**5. Tax Provisions**

The Act permanently codifies the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act individual income tax rates (10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, 37%), which were set to expire in 2025.

[source: Tax Policy Center - 2025 Tax Cuts Tracker](https://taxpolicycenter.org/features/2025-tax-cuts-tracker)

**6. Debt Ceiling**

Raised the federal debt ceiling by $5 trillion to $41.1 trillion.

## Analysis

### What This Means

The OBBBA represents a structural overhaul of how healthcare for low-income Americans is funded. Rather than simply cutting Medicaid benefits directly, the law attacks the *financing mechanisms* states use to fund their share of the program.

**The Provider Tax Trap:** Nearly all states use taxes on hospitals, nursing homes, and care facilities to generate revenue matched by federal funds. By banning this practice, the federal government forces state legislatures into an impossible choice: raise general income or sales taxes to replace lost revenue, or cut Medicaid services and reimbursement rates.

This decentralizes political conflict to 50 state capitols rather than Congress.

**The Enrollment Cliff:** The 6-month reverification requirement (down from 12 months) creates "administrative friction." Eligible people will lose coverage not because they're ineligible, but because underfunded state agencies can't process paperwork fast enough, or because enrollees miss deadlines.

**The Quiet Cut:** Freezing the Thrifty Food Plan composition means SNAP benefits will slowly lose purchasing power relative to the actual cost of a healthy diet. This avoids headline-grabbing benefit cuts while achieving the same result over time.

### Legal/Policy Context

**Current Litigation:**

- *Planned Parenthood v. Kennedy* challenges Section 71113
- Due to *Trump v. CASA* limiting universal injunctions, relief may be geographically limited—clinics may close in some states while litigation continues in others

**Historical Context:**

The provider tax mechanism has been used by states since the 1980s. Eliminating it represents the largest structural change to Medicaid financing since the program's creation in 1965.

**Reconciliation Process:**

The OBBBA was passed through budget reconciliation, requiring only a simple Senate majority (no filibuster). This was possible by tying changes to deficit reduction projections.
