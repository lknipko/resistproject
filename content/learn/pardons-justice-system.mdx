# Pardons & the Assault on Justice

## Quick Summary

On his first day back in office, President Trump issued sweeping clemency to approximately 1,500 January 6th defendants -- including people convicted of assaulting police officers, seditious conspiracy, and weapons offenses. He then moved to dismantle the DOJ's independence: forcing out Special Counsel Jack Smith, retaliating against career prosecutors who worked on January 6th cases, installing loyalists in senior positions, and directing investigations against political opponents. In response, hundreds of federal prosecutors and career DOJ officials have resigned in protest, and federal judges have publicly warned that the rule of law is under siege.

### [+] Retaliation Against January 6th Prosecutors

**Jack Smith -- Special Counsel:**

- Appointed November 2022 by AG Garland
- Indicted Trump on classified documents and election interference
- Resigned January 2025 per DOJ policy on sitting presidents
- Final report: Vol. 1 released; Vol. 2 delayed by legal challenges

- Multiple line prosecutors reassigned or on administrative leave
- Entire Public Integrity Section senior leadership departed by mid-2025
- DOJ compiled lists of prosecutors who worked on Trump cases

**Chilling Effect:**

- Fear of retaliation for past assignments
- Prosecutors retained private counsel
- Reluctance to pursue sensitive investigations
- Officials told to "keep their heads down"

[source: 2025 DOJ Resignations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_U.S._Department_of_Justice_resignations)

### [+] DOJ Politicization Under AG Pam Bondi

Confirmed February 5, 2025 (51-48, party line).

**At confirmation, Bondi:**
- Refused to protect Special Counsel investigations
- Would not commit to resisting White House prosecution directives
- Promised to review all investigations for "political bias"
- Committed to investigating "weaponized" Biden DOJ

[source: Senate Judiciary Committee transcripts]

**Actions taken:**

- Disbanded J6 prosecution team; dismissed remaining cases
- Created Task Force on Weaponization of Government
- Removed/reassigned career officials; installed political appointees
- Directed FBI to halt/review certain investigations
- Forced U.S. Attorney resignations outside normal transitions

| Position | Action | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| 93 U.S. Attorneys | Mass resignation | Loyalty-based replacements |
| Public Integrity Section | Leadership departed | Corruption unit gutted |
| FBI senior leadership | Removals | Investigations disrupted |
| Office of Professional Responsibility | Under review | Oversight weakened |
| Career SES officials | Reassigned | Institutional memory lost |

[source: DOJ releases; Senate Judiciary oversight correspondence]

### [+] Prosecutors and Officials Resigning in Protest

**DOJ Departures:**

- **Public Integrity Section** -- Virtually entire senior staff gone; prosecuted corruption of both parties for decades
- **Line prosecutors nationwide** -- AUSAs resigned rather than carry out political directives
- **FBI agents** -- J6 and counterintelligence agents took early retirement
- **Civil Rights Division** -- Attorneys left as division abandoned voting rights and police reform

**Judges Speaking Out:**

- **Judge Royce Lamberth** (Reagan appointee) -- Pardons "an affront to the rule of law," "make a mockery of law enforcement sacrifices"
- **Judge Amit Mehta** -- Bench statements on pardoning seditious conspirators
- **Judge Timothy Kelly** (Trump appointee) -- Concern about pardons covering violent offenders
- **Chief Justice Roberts** -- 2024 year-end report emphasized judicial independence

Multiple judges took early retirement citing political environment.

[source: Court transcripts; Roberts 2024 Year-End Report; AO records]

### [+] Attacks on Judicial Independence

**Judges Attacked:**

- **Juan Merchan** (NY) -- "Conflicted"; suggested should be jailed
- **Tanya Chutkan** (D.C.) -- Publicly attacked; allies sent threats
- **Arthur Engoron** (NY) -- Called "corrupt," "incompetent"
- **Lewis Kaplan** (NY) -- Attacked publicly and repeatedly
- **James Boasberg** (FISA Court) -- Trump suggested impeachment

**Systemic Attacks:**

- Judges called "radical," "corrupt," "enemies of the people"
- Impeachment threatened for unfavorable rulings
- Questioned legitimacy of judicial review itself
- J6 defendants praised as "patriots"; sentencing judges attacked

**Defiance of Courts:**

- Slow-walked immigration court orders (Alien Enemies Act flights, 2025)
- Questioned whether executive is bound by judicial orders
- Officials suggested ignoring court rulings
- Attempted to strip court jurisdiction

### [+] Using DOJ to Target Political Opponents

| Target | Stated Basis | Real Context |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Jack Smith | "Prosecutorial misconduct" | Prosecuted Trump |
| J6 Select Committee | Congressional abuse | Investigated Trump's J6 role |
| Liz Cheney | Witness tampering | Led committee; referred Trump |
| Comey, McCabe (FBI) | "FISA abuse" | Trump-Russia investigation |
| Fani Willis (DA) | Misconduct | Georgia RICO charges |
| Alvin Bragg (DA) | Political targeting | NY criminal charges |

**Bondi's Weaponization Task Force:**
- Subpoena power; classified access
- Political appointee staff
- Every target investigated/prosecuted Trump

DOJ's own Principles of Federal Prosecution (U.S. Attorneys' Manual, Title 9) prohibit charging based on political associations or lawful government service.

## Analysis

The J6 pardons and DOJ politicization represent the most significant threat to American justice since Watergate -- but far broader in scope.

### [+] What This Means

**Pardoning an Attack on Democracy:**

January 6th was an attempt to prevent the lawful transfer of presidential power. Pardoning everyone involved:

1. **Eliminates the deterrent against political violence.** Attack the government for a politician; get pardoned if they win.
2. **Rewards the most violent.** Blanket coverage -- trespass to seditious conspiracy -- says severity does not matter.
3. **Invalidates the largest federal investigation in history.** 1,500+ cases and jury verdicts nullified.
4. **Betrays law enforcement.** Five officers died; 140+ were assaulted. Their attackers walk free.

**DOJ as Political Weapon:**

- Investigations target those who investigated the president
- Cases dropped based on loyalty, not evidence
- Career prosecutors purged; loyalists installed
- Message: loyalty to president over law

**Expertise Exodus:**

Lost irreplaceable knowledge: ongoing investigations, case-building memory, witness relationships, classified expertise, specialized law. Rebuilding takes decades.

### [+] Who's Affected

- **Law enforcement** -- 140+ assaulted officers see attackers freed and celebrated
- **Election security** -- No deterrent against future attacks on certification
- **DOJ defendants** -- Can argue political application of law
- **Public trust** -- Equal justice foundation shattered
- **Career servants** -- Impossible choice between political orders and resignation
- **Intelligence community** -- DOJ cooperation compromised

### [+] Historical Context

No president has pardoned attackers of the U.S. government itself. Johnson's Confederate amnesty followed a war; Carter's draft amnesty addressed conscience objectors. Trump pardoned people who attacked the Capitol while he was the political beneficiary -- a closed loop of violence and reward.

The Saturday Night Massacre (1973) -- Nixon fired Special Prosecutor Cox; AG Richardson resigned in protest. Current situation is worse: AG Bondi carries out directives willingly, retaliation spans hundreds of attorneys, no independent counsel statute exists, and the Senate has not acted.

| President | Pardon | Context |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Andrew Johnson (1868) | Confederate amnesty | Post-Civil War reconciliation |
| Gerald Ford (1974) | Richard Nixon | Pre-emptive Watergate pardon |
| Jimmy Carter (1977) | Vietnam draft evaders | ~100,000 amnestied |
| George H.W. Bush (1992) | Iran-Contra defendants | 6 officials including Weinberger |
| Bill Clinton (2001) | Marc Rich | Fugitive financier |
| Trump (2020, 1st term) | Stone, Manafort, Flynn | Russia investigation allies |

### [+] The Precedent Being Set

**Political violence template:** encourage violence, supporters prosecuted, regain power, pardon supporters. Any future president can follow this.

**DOJ independence destroyed:** Future AGs expected to target predecessors. Career prosecutors self-censor. Facts-based prosecution impossible when political loyalty protects targets.

**Judicial independence undermined:** Judges may factor retaliation into rulings. Fewer seek appointment. Courts' legitimacy as executive check weakened.

The rule of law depends on norms, knowledge, and public servants willing to defend it. Each is under direct attack.
