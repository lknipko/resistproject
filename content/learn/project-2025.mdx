# Project 2025: The Blueprint Being Followed

## Quick Summary

Project 2025 is a 922-page policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation in 2023, written by over 100 contributors including dozens who now hold senior administration positions. Despite Trump's repeated claims that he knew "nothing about Project 2025" and had "no idea who is behind it," the administration has implemented the majority of its key proposals across immigration, environment, healthcare, education, civil service, and law enforcement. The document, titled "Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise," is publicly available and serves as the detailed roadmap for the restructuring of the federal government currently underway.

## Facts

### Key Points

- **What it is:** A 922-page policy blueprint titled "Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise," published by the Heritage Foundation in April 2023, with detailed plans for restructuring every federal agency.
- **Who wrote it:** Over 100 contributors from conservative organizations, coordinated by Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts. At least 140 contributors were involved across the four "pillars" of the project.
- **The four pillars:** (1) The policy guide itself, (2) a personnel database of pre-vetted loyalists, (3) a "Presidential Administration Academy" training program, and (4) a 180-day transition playbook for the first six months.
- **Authors in government:** At least 66 Project 2025 contributors have been appointed to administration positions, many heading the exact agencies they wrote plans to restructure.
- **Trump's denial:** On July 5, 2024, Trump posted on Truth Social: "I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it." Heritage Foundation is run by people who have advised him since 2016.
- **Implementation rate:** Independent tracking by multiple news organizations found that the administration acted on roughly two-thirds of Project 2025's major policy recommendations within the first year.
- **Heritage Foundation's own claim:** Heritage President Kevin Roberts stated in January 2025 that the incoming administration had already begun implementing the blueprint, calling it "the most comprehensive conservative governance agenda in American history."
- **Scope:** The document covers every cabinet department and major agency, with specific proposals for staffing, budgets, regulatory changes, and organizational restructuring.

### [+] What Is Project 2025?

**The Document:**

"Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise" is a 922-page policy guide published by the Heritage Foundation in April 2023. It is the ninth edition of the Heritage Foundation's "Mandate for Leadership" series, which has been published ahead of Republican presidencies since 1981. The Reagan administration reportedly adopted roughly 60% of the first edition's proposals.

[source: Project 2025 - Mandate for Leadership](https://www.project2025.org/playbook/)

**The Four Pillars:**

Project 2025 is more than a document. It consists of four interconnected components:

1. **The Policy Guide** (Mandate for Leadership) -- 922 pages of specific policy proposals organized by federal agency, with chapter-by-chapter instructions for restructuring the executive branch.

2. **The Personnel Database** -- A database of thousands of pre-vetted conservative applicants ready to fill government positions on Day One. The Heritage Foundation recruited and screened candidates based on loyalty to the agenda.

3. **The Presidential Administration Academy** -- An online training program that prepared conservative candidates for government service, teaching them how to navigate federal bureaucracy and implement the agenda from within.

4. **The 180-Day Playbook** -- A detailed transition plan for the first six months of the administration, with specific executive orders, regulatory actions, and staffing decisions ready for immediate implementation.

[source: Heritage Foundation - Project 2025 Overview](https://www.project2025.org/)

**Who Wrote It:**

The document was produced under the direction of Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts. Paul Dans, former chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management during Trump's first term, served as Project Director until he resigned in July 2024 after Trump publicly distanced himself from the project. Spencer Chretien, also a former Trump administration official, served as Associate Director.

Over 100 named contributors wrote individual chapters. Key authors include:

- **Roger Severino** (Chapter on HHS) -- Former Director of the Office for Civil Rights at HHS under Trump
- **Russ Vought** (Chapter on Executive Office of the President) -- Former Director of the Office of Management and Budget under Trump
- **Peter Navarro** (Trade policy sections) -- Former Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy
- **Ken Cuccinelli** (Chapter on DHS) -- Former Acting Deputy Secretary of DHS under Trump
- **Christopher Miller** (Chapter on DOD) -- Former Acting Secretary of Defense under Trump
- **Gene Hamilton** (Chapter on DOJ) -- Former Counselor to the Attorney General, close associate of Stephen Miller

The project involved approximately 75 partner organizations, including the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), Claremont Institute, Federalist Society, and America First Legal (Stephen Miller's organization).

[source: Project 2025 Mandate for Leadership - Authors and Contributors](https://www.project2025.org/playbook/)

**Stated Goals:**

The document explicitly calls for:
- Consolidating executive power under the president ("unitary executive theory")
- Eliminating or restructuring entire federal agencies (Department of Education, NOAA, EPA offices)
- Replacing career civil servants with political loyalists (Schedule F)
- Reversing climate and environmental regulations
- Restricting immigration through executive action
- Eliminating DEI programs across the federal government
- Restricting reproductive healthcare access
- Defunding public media (NPR, PBS, CPB)
- Withdrawing from international climate agreements

### [+] Trump's Denials vs. Reality

**Trump's Statements:**

| Date | Statement |
|------|-----------|
| July 5, 2024 | Truth Social post: "I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they're saying and some of the things they're saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them." |
| September 10, 2024 | Presidential debate: "I have nothing to do with Project 2025. That's out there. I haven't read it. I don't want to read it, purposely." |
| October 2024 | Multiple campaign events: Repeated variations of "I don't know anything about it." |

[source: Trump Truth Social Post, July 5, 2024](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump)

**The Reality:**

**Direct connections between Trump and Heritage Foundation:**
- Heritage Foundation has advised Trump since his first presidential campaign in 2016
- Heritage provided numerous personnel for Trump's first term (2017-2021)
- Kevin Roberts, Heritage President, had regular meetings with Trump's inner circle during the 2024 campaign
- Trump spoke at Heritage Foundation events multiple times
- Many Project 2025 authors were Trump's own former appointees who wrote their chapters based on their first-term experience

**Implementation of P2025 proposals (documented in the Implementation Tracker below):**
- Day One executive orders closely tracked P2025's 180-day playbook
- Specific policy proposals from the document have been enacted across every federal agency
- The personnel database was used to fill administration positions
- Authors of specific chapters were appointed to lead the agencies they wrote about

**Heritage Foundation's response to Trump's denial:**
- Kevin Roberts publicly stated that the project was designed for "the next conservative president" and that its proposals were being adopted
- Heritage released statements noting that over 60% of the Reagan-era Mandate proposals were implemented and projected similar or higher adoption for this edition
- Roberts said in a July 2024 interview: "We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be."

### [+] Stephen Miller's Role

**Background:**

Stephen Miller served as Senior Advisor to President Trump during his first term (2017-2021), where he was the primary architect of the administration's immigration policies including the travel ban, family separation policy, and "Remain in Mexico" program. After leaving government, he founded America First Legal Foundation (AFL) in 2021, which became one of the approximately 75 partner organizations involved in Project 2025.

**Current Position:**

Miller returned to the White House in January 2025 as Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, one of the most powerful positions in the West Wing. He oversees domestic policy across all agencies and is widely reported as the driving force behind the administration's most aggressive executive actions.

[source: White House Staff Announcements, January 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/)

**Policy Influence:**

Miller is documented as the architect or primary advocate for:

- **Executive Order 14160** (Birthright Citizenship): Directs agencies to deny recognition of citizenship for children born to undocumented parents or temporary visa holders. [See: [Birthright Citizenship](/learn/birthright-citizenship)]
- **Mass deportation operations:** Expanded ICE enforcement including operations in schools, churches, and courthouses -- previously designated as "sensitive locations" off-limits to enforcement
- **Ending sensitive locations policy:** The elimination of the policy that had protected schools, hospitals, and houses of worship from immigration raids
- **Alien Enemies Act invocation:** Use of the 1798 wartime statute to bypass immigration courts for deportation of alleged gang members
- **Military deployment to the border:** Expansion of active-duty military presence for immigration enforcement operations
- **Elimination of refugee resettlement programs:** Dramatic reduction in refugee admissions from 125,000 cap to near zero
- **Termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS):** Ending protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Haiti, Venezuela, El Salvador, Honduras, and other nations

**America First Legal:**

Between leaving government in 2021 and returning in 2025, Miller ran America First Legal Foundation, which:
- Filed over 100 lawsuits against the Biden administration on immigration, DEI, and other issues
- Was listed as a partner organization of Project 2025
- Provided legal frameworks and policy proposals that were incorporated into the Mandate for Leadership
- Received significant funding from conservative donors including the Bradley Foundation and Donors Trust
- Built a litigation infrastructure that is now being used in reverse -- AFL's legal theories are now administration policy

**Documented Statements:**

Miller has been quoted in multiple contexts:
- Describing mass deportation as "the largest domestic law enforcement operation in American history"
- Calling for the use of the National Guard and military for immigration enforcement
- Advocating for ending birthright citizenship through executive action
- Stating that "no one is off the table" for deportation, including long-term residents with no criminal record

### [+] The Federal Workforce Plan

Project 2025's Chapter 3 on "Central Personnel Agencies" lays out a comprehensive plan to replace the merit-based civil service with a system of political loyalty. This is among the most consequential sections of the document because it enables implementation of everything else.

**Schedule F / Schedule Policy-Career:**

The document calls for reclassifying career federal employees in "policy-influencing" roles to a new employment category that strips civil service protections. This was implemented through Executive Order 14171 on January 20, 2025, the first day of the administration.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) estimated that over 50,000 positions could be reclassified, including scientists, economists, lawyers, and policy analysts across every agency.

[See full details: [Schedule F and the Dismantling of the Administrative State](/learn/schedule-f)]

**The DOGE Connection:**

While not explicitly part of Project 2025, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, has implemented many of the workforce reduction goals outlined in the document. DOGE's actions include:
- Mass termination of probationary employees across agencies
- Closure of entire offices (USAID, DEI offices, environmental justice programs)
- Reduction of telework to force attrition
- Access to sensitive personnel and payment systems

These actions align with P2025's Chapter 3 goals of reducing the federal workforce and eliminating institutional resistance to the administration's agenda.

**Personnel Database in Practice:**

The Heritage Foundation's pre-vetted personnel database, one of Project 2025's four pillars, has been used to fill positions across the government. This ensures that appointees arrive with pre-existing commitment to the P2025 agenda rather than to the traditional mission of their agencies.

[source: Executive Order 14171](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-accountability-to-policy-influencing-positions-within-the-federal-workforce/)

### [+] The Education Plan

Project 2025's Chapter 11 calls for the eventual elimination of the Department of Education and a fundamental restructuring of how the federal government relates to K-12 and higher education.

**Key Proposals and Status:**

**Eliminate the Department of Education** (p. 319):
- The document calls for transferring some functions to other agencies and eliminating others entirely
- Status: The administration has introduced legislation to abolish the department and proposed dramatic budget cuts
- Key functions like student loan servicing and Title I funding would be moved or eliminated

**Expand School Choice** (p. 323):
- Federal funding for school vouchers, education savings accounts, and charter school expansion
- Status: Budget proposal includes a federal voucher program; multiple states passing voucher legislation with administration encouragement

**Reverse Title IX Protections** (p. 333):
- Rescind Biden-era regulations extending Title IX protections to transgender students
- Status: Enacted. The Biden rule was rescinded and replaced with narrower protections

**End Student Loan Forgiveness** (p. 340):
- Halt all student loan forgiveness programs including income-driven repayment forgiveness
- Status: Multiple programs halted; SAVE plan blocked; Public Service Loan Forgiveness under review

**Restrict "Divisive Concepts"** (p. 345):
- Ban teaching of Critical Race Theory and related frameworks in federally funded institutions
- Status: Executive order signed banning "divisive concepts" in federal programs and contracts, with conditions on federal education funding

[source: Project 2025 Mandate for Leadership, Chapter 11](https://www.project2025.org/playbook/)

### [+] The Environmental Plan

Project 2025 devotes multiple chapters to energy and environmental policy, with proposals that represent the most comprehensive rollback of environmental protections in modern U.S. history.

**EPA (Chapter 12, pp. 378-420):**

The document calls for:
- Dramatically reducing EPA's regulatory authority
- Eliminating the Office of Environmental Justice
- Repealing the Clean Power Plan and related greenhouse gas regulations
- Weakening the Clean Water Act's "Waters of the United States" (WOTUS) definition
- Reducing air quality monitoring requirements
- Cutting EPA's budget and workforce by at least 50%

Status: The administration has rescinded major EPA rules, eliminated the Office of Environmental Justice, initiated withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, and proposed deep budget cuts to the agency.

**Energy (Chapter 13, pp. 430-470):**

The document calls for:
- "Energy dominance" through expanded fossil fuel production
- Opening federal lands and waters to oil, gas, and coal leasing
- Eliminating clean energy subsidies and tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act
- Restructuring or eliminating the Department of Energy's loan programs office
- Ending the social cost of carbon in regulatory analysis

Status: Multiple executive orders have declared energy emergencies, expanded fossil fuel leasing, and targeted IRA clean energy provisions for repeal.

**NOAA (Chapter 22, pp. 664-680):**

The document calls for:
- Privatizing the National Weather Service's commercial data functions
- Reducing climate research funding at NOAA
- Restructuring or eliminating NOAA as an independent agency
- Ending NOAA's climate monitoring and reporting functions

Status: Budget proposals include significant NOAA cuts; climate research programs have been defunded or paused.

## Analysis

Project 2025 represents something fundamentally different from standard policy transitions between administrations. Previous "Mandate for Leadership" editions proposed policy changes within existing institutional structures. This edition proposes replacing the structures themselves -- the career civil service, independent regulatory agencies, and the separation between political direction and professional execution that has defined American governance since the Pendleton Act of 1883.

### [+] What This Means

**This is not ad hoc -- it is systematic:**

The most important thing to understand about Project 2025 is that the policies being implemented are not improvised responses to events. They are the execution of a pre-written plan, developed over years, by people who now hold the positions of power needed to implement it.

This matters because:
- The speed of implementation is intentional, designed to overwhelm legal and political opposition
- Each policy change reinforces others (Schedule F enables EPA gutting enables energy deregulation)
- The personnel database ensures appointees arrive with ideological commitment to the agenda
- The 180-day playbook front-loaded the most consequential changes

**Institutional capture:**

When authors of a plan to restructure an agency are appointed to lead that agency, it is not a coincidence. Russ Vought wrote the chapter on expanding OMB's power and now runs OMB. Brendan Carr wrote the chapter on restructuring the FCC and now chairs it. This pattern repeats across the government.

This represents a form of institutional capture where the people directing agencies have a pre-existing commitment to a specific agenda that may conflict with the agency's statutory mission.

**The denial strategy:**

Trump's public disavowal of Project 2025 served a political purpose during the campaign, when the document's more extreme proposals (eliminating the Department of Education, restricting contraception access, mass deportation) were politically toxic. Once in office, the denials became irrelevant as the policies were implemented regardless of whether they were publicly attributed to the document.

### [+] What Hasn't Been Implemented Yet

Based on the document, the following major proposals have not yet been fully enacted but may be pursued:

**Still Pending:**
- Full elimination of the Department of Education (legislation introduced but not passed)
- Restrictions on contraception access through federal programs
- Privatization of National Weather Service functions
- Full elimination of clean energy tax credits (requires Congressional action)
- Restructuring of the Federal Reserve's mandate
- Withdrawal from additional international agreements and organizations
- National abortion restrictions through regulatory action
- Elimination of Head Start and federal childcare programs
- Restructuring of Social Security disability programs

**Requires Congressional Action:**
- Many of the most far-reaching proposals (eliminating departments, restructuring entitlements, repealing laws) require legislation that has not yet been passed
- The reconciliation process used for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act demonstrates the mechanism for enacting budget-related P2025 proposals
- Additional reconciliation bills may be used to implement remaining fiscal proposals

**Watch For:**
- FCC actions on content moderation and broadcast licensing (Brendan Carr chapter)
- Further NOAA restructuring and climate data restrictions
- Expansion of Schedule F classifications beyond initial 50,000 positions
- Federal funding conditions tied to ideological compliance
- Additional uses of the Alien Enemies Act and other wartime statutes

### [+] The Network Behind Project 2025

Project 2025 is not solely a Heritage Foundation initiative. It represents a coordinated effort by approximately 75 conservative organizations that contributed personnel, policy expertise, and institutional support.

**Core Organizations:**

- **Heritage Foundation** -- Lead organization; published the document; runs the personnel database
- **America First Legal** (Stephen Miller) -- Immigration policy; litigation infrastructure
- **Federalist Society** -- Judicial nominations; legal theory (unitary executive)
- **Claremont Institute** -- Constitutional theory; administrative state critique
- **American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)** -- State-level policy coordination

**Funding Network:**

The organizations behind Project 2025 share overlapping donor networks:
- **Donors Trust / Donors Capital Fund** -- Anonymous donor-advised fund supporting multiple P2025 partners
- **Bradley Foundation** -- Major funder of Heritage, AFL, and other partners
- **Koch network** -- Americans for Prosperity and affiliated organizations
- **Mercer family** -- Long-term Heritage and conservative movement funders
- **Leonard Leo / Marble Freedom Trust** -- Connections to judicial nominations and Federalist Society

**The Personnel Pipeline:**

The network functions as a talent pipeline: young conservatives are recruited through Federalist Society chapters and Heritage internship programs, trained through the Presidential Administration Academy, vetted through the personnel database, and placed in government positions. This creates a self-reinforcing system where ideological alignment is the primary qualification for federal service.
