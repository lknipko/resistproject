# Leaving the WHO & Dismantling Public Health

## Quick Summary

The United States withdrew from the World Health Organization on January 20, 2025, severing participation in global disease surveillance. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was confirmed as HHS Secretary and has overseen sweeping changes: vaccine schedule reclassifications, mass firings at CDC, FDA, and NIH, the gutting of pandemic preparedness programs, and the suppression of scientific advisory committees. The cumulative result is the most significant dismantling of federal public health infrastructure since these agencies were created.

### [+] WHO Withdrawal

**The Executive Order**

On his first day in office, January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order directing the withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization. The order cited concerns about WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, alleged Chinese influence, and characterized U.S. contributions as disproportionate.

[source: Executive Order on WHO Withdrawal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-world-health-organization/)

**Legal Process**

Under the terms of a 1948 joint resolution by Congress that approved U.S. membership in WHO, withdrawal requires:
- A one-year notice period
- Payment of assessed financial obligations
- Congressional notification

The withdrawal formally takes effect January 20, 2026.

[source: Congressional Research Service - WHO Withdrawal](https://crsreports.congress.gov/)

**What the WHO Does**

The World Health Organization coordinates international public health efforts including:

- **Disease surveillance:** The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) detects and responds to disease outbreaks in 194 member states
- **International Health Regulations (IHR):** Legally binding framework requiring nations to report disease outbreaks
- **Pandemic preparedness:** Coordinates global response to pandemics, including vaccine distribution through COVAX
- **Polio eradication:** The Global Polio Eradication Initiative has reduced polio cases by 99.9% since 1988
- **Disease elimination programs:** Coordinates efforts against malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and neglected tropical diseases
- **Health standards:** Sets international standards for drug quality, food safety, and disease classification (ICD codes used by every U.S. hospital)

[source: WHO Overview](https://www.who.int/about)

**What the U.S. Loses**

- **Early warning access:** WHO's Health Emergencies Programme monitors disease outbreaks worldwide. Without membership, the U.S. loses real-time access to intelligence about emerging threats before they reach American borders
- **Negotiating power:** The U.S. shaped WHO policy, drug pricing frameworks, and intellectual property rules. China and other nations now fill that leadership vacuum
- **Research networks:** Thousands of U.S. scientists participate in WHO research collaborations. These partnerships become legally complicated without membership
- **IHR compliance data:** Other nations are legally obligated to report outbreaks to WHO member states. The U.S. will need bilateral agreements to maintain access
- **Pandemic Treaty participation:** The WHO Pandemic Preparedness Treaty, under negotiation since 2021, will proceed without U.S. input

[source: Council on Foreign Relations - U.S. WHO Withdrawal](https://www.cfr.org/)

**Previous Withdrawal Attempt**

President Trump initiated WHO withdrawal in July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. President Biden reversed that decision on his first day in office, January 20, 2021. The 2025 withdrawal is the second attempt.

### [+] RFK Jr. at HHS

**Background**

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was nominated as Secretary of Health and Human Services in November 2024. He is the founder of Children's Health Defense (formerly World Mercury Project), an organization that the Center for Countering Digital Hate identified as one of the top sources of anti-vaccine misinformation online.

Kennedy has no medical degree, no public health training, and no government healthcare administration experience. His professional background is in environmental law.

**Key Statements and Positions**

Before his confirmation, Kennedy publicly stated:
- Vaccines cause autism (a claim debunked by extensive scientific research including a 2019 study of 657,461 children in Denmark)
- Wi-Fi radiation causes cancer
- Antidepressants are linked to school shootings
- HIV does not cause AIDS (a claim he later partially walked back)
- Fluoride in drinking water harms children's cognitive development

[source: Senate HELP Committee Confirmation Hearing Testimony](https://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/nomination-of-robert-f-kennedy-jr-to-serve-as-secretary-of-health-and-human-services)

**Confirmation**

Kennedy was confirmed by the Senate on September 18, 2025, by a vote of 52-48, with all Democrats and one Republican opposing.

**Actions as HHS Secretary**

Since taking office, Kennedy has:

1. **Reconstituted scientific advisory committees:** Replaced members of CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), FDA advisory panels, and NIH study sections with appointees aligned with his views on vaccines and alternative medicine

2. **Reclassified the vaccine schedule:** Oversaw the reclassification of six childhood vaccines from "routine" to "Shared Clinical Decision-Making," triggering pharmacy access restrictions in 25 states (see [Vaccine Schedule Changes](/learn/vaccine-schedule))

3. **Ordered a review of fluoride in drinking water:** Directed HHS to review the safety of water fluoridation, despite decades of evidence supporting fluoride's effectiveness in preventing tooth decay. The American Dental Association, CDC, and WHO all endorse community water fluoridation

4. **Launched "Make America Healthy Again" initiative:** Focused on food additives, processed food regulation, and chronic disease prevention while simultaneously undermining vaccination programs that prevent acute infectious disease

5. **Initiated mass layoffs:** Oversaw the termination of thousands of career scientists and public health officials across HHS agencies, including epidemiologists at CDC, researchers at NIH, and food safety inspectors at FDA

6. **Weakened vaccine safety monitoring:** Altered reporting requirements and communication protocols for the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which already suffers from misinterpretation by anti-vaccine groups

[source: HHS Press Releases](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/index.html)

---

### [+] CDC Political Interference

**Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)**

ACIP is the expert committee that has set vaccination recommendations in the United States since 1964. Its 15 members are selected for scientific and clinical expertise, not political affiliation. ACIP's recommendations have historically been adopted by the CDC director with minimal political interference.

Under the Kennedy HHS:
- Multiple ACIP members were replaced before their terms expired
- The committee's recommendation process was altered to require HHS political approval before public release
- The January 2026 vaccine reclassification bypassed ACIP entirely, with political appointees overriding the scientific committee's recommendations

[source: CDC ACIP Charter](https://www.cdc.gov/acip/about/charter.html)

**Career Scientist Departures**

According to reports from current and former CDC employees:
- Hundreds of career epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and public health scientists have been fired, placed on administrative leave, or resigned under pressure
- The National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID) has lost significant staff
- The Division of Global Migration and Quarantine has been downsized
- Institutional knowledge built over decades of outbreak response is being lost

[source: Government Accountability Project](https://whistleblower.org/)

**Scientific Communications Altered**

- CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), the agency's primary scientific publication since 1952, has been subjected to political review before publication
- Public-facing health guidance on vaccines, infectious disease prevention, and chronic disease has been altered or removed from CDC's website
- CDC communications staff have been instructed to avoid language about vaccine safety and efficacy that contradicts HHS messaging

[source: CDC MMWR Archives](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html)

**Specific Instances**

- **Measles guidance weakened:** CDC guidance on measles outbreak response was altered to emphasize "parental choice" rather than vaccination as the primary prevention strategy, even as measles cases surged in 2025
- **COVID surveillance reduced:** Wastewater surveillance and hospital reporting requirements were scaled back, reducing the nation's ability to track respiratory disease spread
- **Chronic disease data suppressed:** Reports linking environmental factors to chronic disease were delayed or modified when they conflicted with administration deregulation priorities

---

### [+] NIH Funding Cuts

**Budget Reductions**

The National Institutes of Health, the world's largest public funder of biomedical research, has faced unprecedented budget proposals:

- The administration's FY2026 budget proposed cutting NIH funding by approximately 40%, from $47.3 billion to roughly $28 billion
- The proposed cuts would be the largest reduction in NIH history
- In FY2025, a continuing resolution combined with executive-ordered spending freezes already reduced effective NIH funding

[source: NIH Budget Overview](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/budget)

**Grant Freezes**

- Thousands of active research grants were frozen or delayed in early 2025 when the administration imposed a government-wide spending freeze
- New grant applications faced extended review timelines
- Renewals of multi-year grants were placed under additional political review
- Indirect cost rate caps were proposed that would make many university-based research projects financially unviable

**Programs Threatened or Cut**

| Program | Status | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **National Cancer Institute** | Funding reduced | Ongoing clinical trials disrupted |
| **National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)** | Major restructuring | Infectious disease research reduced |
| **Fogarty International Center** | Proposed for elimination | International research training ended |
| **National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences** | Funding reduced | Drug development pipeline slowed |
| **All of Us Research Program** | Under review | Precision medicine database at risk |
| **BRAIN Initiative** | Funding reduced | Neuroscience research disrupted |

[source: Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB)](https://www.faseb.org/)

**Researcher Impact**

- Principal investigators reported being unable to pay research staff
- Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows faced sudden loss of funding
- International researchers on visas tied to NIH-funded positions faced deportation risk
- Multiple universities announced hiring freezes in biomedical departments
- The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) warned of a "brain drain" as researchers seek positions abroad

[source: Association of American Medical Colleges](https://www.aamc.org/)

### [+] FDA Changes

**Regulatory Capacity**

The Food and Drug Administration oversees the safety of products accounting for approximately 20 cents of every dollar spent by American consumers, including prescription drugs, medical devices, food, cosmetics, and tobacco products.

Under the current administration:

- **Hiring freezes** have left hundreds of FDA positions unfilled, including drug reviewers, food safety inspectors, and device evaluators
- **Staff reductions** through layoffs and voluntary buyouts have reduced the agency's workforce
- **Budget cuts** have forced prioritization of certain review processes over others

**Drug Safety Monitoring**

- Post-market surveillance of approved drugs has been weakened
- The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) staffing has been reduced
- Drug safety communications have been delayed or subjected to political review

**Food Safety**

- The number of food facility inspections has decreased
- Import screening for contaminated food has been scaled back
- The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) implementation has slowed

[source: FDA Strategic Priorities](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/reports/fda-strategic-priorities)

**Approval Process Changes**

- "Right to Try" expansion proposals would allow less-tested treatments to reach patients
- Industry representatives have been placed on advisory committees traditionally reserved for independent scientists
- Accelerated approval pathways have been discussed for supplements and alternative treatments that have not undergone traditional clinical trials

---

### [+] Pandemic Preparedness Dismantled

**ASPR and BARDA**

The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) are the primary federal agencies responsible for preparing for and responding to health emergencies.

- ASPR coordinates the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) with over 5,000 medical professionals on call
- BARDA develops medical countermeasures including vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics
- These agencies were central to the COVID-19 response, facilitating Operation Warp Speed

Under the current administration:
- ASPR leadership positions have been left vacant or filled with political appointees
- BARDA's advanced development portfolio has been reduced
- The Strategic National Stockpile, which maintains emergency medical supplies, has seen management changes and budget uncertainty

[source: ASPR About](https://aspr.hhs.gov/AboutASPR/Pages/default.aspx)

**Global Health Security Agenda**

The Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), launched in 2014, helps countries prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. Programs include:

- Training foreign epidemiologists to detect outbreaks before they spread internationally
- Laboratory strengthening in countries with weak health systems
- Emergency operations center development in partner nations

These programs have been defunded or scaled back, removing America's early warning system for emerging pandemics. The CDC's Global Health Center, which maintained field offices in dozens of countries monitoring for new diseases, has been downsized.

[source: Global Health Security Agenda](https://ghsagenda.org/)

**Expert Staff Losses**

- Career pandemic preparedness officials have been fired or resigned
- The National Security Council's directorate for global health security, eliminated in 2018 and restored in 2021, has been downsized again
- State and local health departments that relied on federal funding for emergency preparedness have lost support

**Comparison to Pre-COVID State**

Before COVID-19, experts warned that the U.S. was unprepared for a pandemic. The Global Health Security Index ranked the U.S. first in pandemic preparedness in 2019, but noted significant gaps. COVID-19 killed over 1.2 million Americans. The current dismantling of preparedness infrastructure leaves the country less prepared than it was before COVID, at a time when climate change and global travel increase pandemic risk.

### [+] Vaccine Policy Changes

**Beyond the Vaccine Schedule**

The vaccine schedule reclassification (covered in detail on the [Vaccine Schedule Changes](/learn/vaccine-schedule) page) is part of a broader pattern of vaccine policy changes:

- **Vaccine confidence messaging removed:** HHS and CDC websites have been altered to remove or soften messaging about vaccine safety and efficacy
- **VAERS misrepresentation:** The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which accepts unverified reports from anyone, has been cited by HHS officials as evidence of vaccine harm, despite the system's explicit disclaimer that reports do not prove causation
- **Vaccines for Children (VFC) program threatened:** The VFC program provides free vaccines to children who are uninsured, underinsured, Medicaid-eligible, or American Indian/Alaska Native. Budget proposals have targeted this program for cuts
- **School vaccination requirements undermined:** While school vaccination requirements are set at the state level, federal messaging questioning vaccine safety has emboldened state legislators to expand exemptions

**Impact on Vaccination Rates**

- Childhood vaccination rates, which were already declining before the pandemic, have dropped further
- The WHO and UNICEF estimated that globally, 14.5 million children missed vaccinations in 2023. U.S. rates are following this trend
- Measles cases surged in 2025, with outbreaks reported in multiple states, particularly in communities with low vaccination rates

[source: CDC Vaccination Coverage Data](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/childvaxview/index.html)

### [+] Impact on Medical Research

**Grant Freezes and Funding Uncertainty**

NIH funds approximately 50,000 research grants at more than 2,500 universities and research institutions across all 50 states. The impact of funding disruption includes:

- **Clinical trials paused:** Patients enrolled in NIH-funded clinical trials for cancer, rare diseases, and chronic conditions face interruption of experimental treatments
- **Laboratory closures:** Research labs that depend on NIH grants have been forced to lay off technicians, postdocs, and graduate students
- **Long-term research abandoned:** Multi-year studies tracking disease progression, drug efficacy, and environmental health effects cannot be paused and restarted

**International Collaboration Disrupted**

- WHO withdrawal severs formal research partnerships
- NIH funding cuts reduce support for international collaborative studies
- Foreign researchers are leaving U.S. institutions due to funding uncertainty and visa complications
- The European Research Council and other international funders have begun recruiting American researchers

**Scientific Brain Drain**

The Association of American Universities (AAU) warned that NIH funding cuts threaten America's global leadership in biomedical research:

- China's biomedical research spending has increased year-over-year while U.S. funding faces cuts
- Canada, the UK, Germany, and Australia have actively recruited American researchers displaced by funding cuts
- The pipeline of future researchers is threatened as graduate students and postdocs leave the field

[source: Association of American Universities](https://www.aau.edu/)

**Economic Impact**

NIH-funded research generates an estimated $103 billion in economic activity annually across the United States. Every state has institutions receiving NIH grants. The economic ripple effect of funding cuts extends far beyond universities to local economies that depend on research institutions as employers and economic drivers.

## Analysis

The dismantling of public health infrastructure is not a single policy change but an interconnected strategy that removes the federal government's capacity to protect Americans from disease, unsafe food and drugs, and future pandemics.

### [+] What This Means

**Pandemic Risk**

The combination of WHO withdrawal, ASPR/BARDA defunding, CDC downsizing, and Global Health Security Agenda cuts removes every layer of the pandemic defense system:

1. **Detection** (Global Health Security Agenda, WHO surveillance) - Defunded
2. **Assessment** (CDC epidemiologists, NIH researchers) - Fired or reassigned
3. **Response** (ASPR coordination, Strategic National Stockpile) - Leadership vacant, budget cut
4. **Treatment** (BARDA medical countermeasures, FDA emergency approvals) - Reduced capacity
5. **Prevention** (Vaccination programs, public health messaging) - Undermined

If a novel pathogen emerges tomorrow, the United States has fewer people, less funding, weaker international partnerships, and degraded domestic infrastructure to respond compared to early 2020, when COVID-19 still killed over 1.2 million Americans.

**Disease Resurgence**

Measles, which was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, is resurging as vaccination rates decline. Measles is a sentinel disease: because it is so contagious (one infected person can infect 12-18 unvaccinated people), it is the first disease to return when vaccination rates drop. Its resurgence signals that less contagious but more deadly diseases will follow if vaccination rates continue to fall.

Polio, pertussis (whooping cough), and other vaccine-preventable diseases pose similar risks. The U.S. detected vaccine-derived poliovirus in New York wastewater in 2022, a warning sign that population immunity was already declining.

**Loss of Global Leadership**

For 75 years, the United States led global health initiatives. This leadership:
- Shaped drug pricing and access frameworks
- Directed pandemic response priorities
- Protected American economic and security interests through disease prevention abroad
- Gave the U.S. influence over health standards that affect global trade

China, the EU, and other actors are filling the vacuum. Once ceded, this leadership will take decades to rebuild, if it can be rebuilt at all.

**Scientific Brain Drain**

The combined effect of NIH funding cuts, political interference at CDC and FDA, and the hostile environment for evidence-based science is driving America's best medical researchers to other countries. This talent loss compounds over years as the research pipeline (graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty) dries up. The U.S. is losing not just current capacity but future generations of scientific leadership.

---

### [+] Who's Affected

**Everyone**

Pandemic preparedness is not a niche concern. COVID-19 killed over 1.2 million Americans, crashed the economy, closed schools, and disrupted every aspect of daily life. The dismantling of preparedness infrastructure means the next pandemic will find the U.S. less prepared than it was in 2020.

**Children**

- Declining vaccination rates increase exposure to measles, whooping cough, and other preventable diseases
- Vaccine schedule reclassification creates pharmacy access barriers (see [Vaccine Schedule Changes](/learn/vaccine-schedule))
- Vaccines for Children (VFC) program funding threatened
- School outbreak risk increases as exemption rates climb

**Rural and Low-Income Americans**

- Pharmacy access restrictions disproportionately affect areas where pharmacies are the primary healthcare access point
- Community health centers relying on federal funding face budget uncertainty
- Medicaid recipients face compounding access barriers from both vaccine policy changes and potential Medicaid cuts (see [OBBBA and Medicaid](/learn/obbba-medicaid))

**Elderly and Immunocompromised**

- Reduced influenza and COVID-19 vaccination rates lower community immunity
- Weakened post-market drug safety monitoring at FDA puts medication safety at risk
- Hospital preparedness funding cuts affect emergency response capacity

**Cancer Patients and People with Chronic Diseases**

- NIH clinical trials disrupted, potentially interrupting experimental treatments
- Cancer research funding cuts slow development of new therapies
- FDA capacity reductions slow drug approval timelines

**Scientific and Medical Communities**

### [+] The Connection to Vaccine Schedule Changes

The vaccine schedule reclassification is one component of the broader public health dismantling documented on this page. Understanding the connections is critical:

**The Chain of Events:**
1. RFK Jr. confirmed as HHS Secretary with authority over CDC, FDA, and NIH
2. ACIP advisory committee reconstituted with appointees aligned with Kennedy's views
3. Six vaccines reclassified from "routine" to "Shared Clinical Decision-Making"
4. State trigger laws restrict pharmacy vaccination access in 25 states
5. Vaccination rates decline, measles cases surge
6. CDC's ability to track and respond to outbreaks simultaneously degraded by staffing cuts

**Each step makes the next worse.** Declining vaccination rates increase disease risk. Reduced CDC surveillance capacity means outbreaks are detected later. Fewer public health workers means slower response. Weakened FDA means medical countermeasures take longer to develop and approve.
