# Schedule F and the Dismantling of the Administrative State

<TopSection>
  <QuickSummary highlight="50,000+ federal employees face political firing.">
    Executive Order 14171 creates a new "Schedule F" category stripping civil service protections from career employees in "policy-influencing" positions. Combined with EO 14192's impossible 10-for-1 deregulation mandate, this creates agencies that cannot regulate and have no institutional memory.

### What Schedule F Does

**Stripping Civil Service Protections:**

Executive Order 14171 creates a new employment category called "Schedule F" (now "Schedule Policy/Career") for federal employees in "policy-influencing" positions.

Employees reclassified to Schedule F lose:
- Tenure protections
- Due process rights before termination
- Appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board
- Protection from political retaliation

**Scope:**

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) estimates **50,000+ career positions** could be reclassified, including:
- Scientists at EPA, FDA, NOAA, CDC
- Economists at Treasury, Labor, Commerce
- Lawyers at DOJ, agency counsel offices
- Policy analysts across all agencies

### What the 10-for-1 Rule Does

**Regulatory Freeze:**

Executive Order 14192 mandates that for every **one new regulation** issued, agencies must identify and repeal **ten existing regulations**.

**Practical Effect:**

Agencies like EPA, OSHA, and FDA cannot issue new safety standards because they cannot find enough "old" rules to repeal to satisfy the 10-for-1 requirement. This creates a de facto regulatory freeze.

### What This Means

**The Institutional Memory Wipe:**

Schedule F is not just about firing employees who resist administration policies. It enables the removal of career staff who understand:
- The legal history of regulations
- Why certain rules exist
- What happened when similar approaches were tried before
- How to implement complex programs

By replacing these experts with political loyalists, the administration removes internal checks on executive power.

**The Regulatory Paralysis:**

The 10-for-1 rule makes governing mathematically impossible. Consider:
- EPA wants to issue a new clean air standard
- They must first repeal 10 existing environmental protections
- Those protections have constituencies who will fight repeal
- Result: No new standards get issued

This achieves deregulation without Congress repealing any laws.

**Combined Effect:**

Schedule F + 10-for-1 = agencies that cannot regulate and have no institutional memory of why regulations existed.

### Who Is Affected

- **Federal employees**: 50,000+ face potential job loss for political reasons
- **Public safety**: EPA, OSHA, FDA staffing cuts degrade enforcement
- **Scientific research**: NOAA, CDC, NIH expertise loss affects forecasting, disease surveillance
- **Future administrations**: Institutional knowledge, once lost, takes decades to rebuild
- **Regulated industries**: Uncertainty about which rules will be repealed creates compliance confusion

### Legal/Policy Context

**Civil Service History:**

The civil service system was created after President Garfield's assassination by a disappointed office-seeker in 1881. The Pendleton Act (1883) established merit-based hiring and protections from political firing. Schedule F represents the most significant rollback of these protections in 140 years.

**Legal Challenges:**

The National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) and other federal employee unions have filed litigation challenging Schedule F, arguing it violates:
- The Civil Service Reform Act
- Due process protections
- Congressional intent in creating career civil service

Status: Ongoing litigation
