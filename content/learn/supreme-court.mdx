# The Supreme Court Crisis

## Quick Summary

**Key Point:** Supreme Court justices have accepted millions of dollars in undisclosed gifts from billionaire benefactors, failed to recuse themselves from cases involving personal conflicts of interest, and issued a series of rulings that dramatically expanded executive power while limiting individual rights -- all while operating under a voluntary ethics code with no enforcement mechanism.

Public approval of the Supreme Court has fallen to historic lows, with a September 2024 Gallup poll showing only 43% of Americans approve of the Court's performance. Multiple reform proposals -- including enforceable ethics codes, term limits, and court expansion -- have been introduced in Congress but face significant political obstacles.

## Facts

### Key Points

- **Justice Clarence Thomas** accepted at least $4.2 million in undisclosed gifts from billionaire Harlan Crow between 2004 and 2023, including luxury travel, a $267,230 real estate transaction, and private school tuition for a family member, according to ProPublica's multi-part investigation and Senate Judiciary Committee findings.

- **Justice Samuel Alito** accepted an undisclosed luxury fishing trip to Alaska valued at over $100,000 from billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Singer, who subsequently had business before the Court. Alito did not recuse himself from *Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital* (2014), a case in which Singer's fund was the primary litigant, and voted in Singer's favor.

- **The Supreme Court adopted a voluntary ethics code** in November 2023 -- for the first time in its history -- but the code contains **no enforcement mechanism**, no independent investigatory body, and no consequences for violations. Lower federal judges are bound by enforceable ethics rules under 28 U.S.C. Section 455 and the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act, but Supreme Court justices are exempt.

- **Thomas did not recuse** from cases related to January 6 and the 2020 election despite his wife Virginia "Ginni" Thomas's documented involvement in efforts to overturn the election results, including text messages to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows urging him to challenge the election outcome.

- **Six of the nine current justices** were nominated by Republican presidents. Five of the six conservative justices were members of or closely associated with the Federalist Society before their nomination. All three Trump appointees (Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Barrett) were selected from lists curated with significant input from Federalist Society leadership.

- **The Court has issued a series of rulings** expanding executive power and limiting oversight, including *Trump v. United States* (2024) granting broad presidential immunity, *Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo* (2024) overturning the Chevron doctrine and weakening federal agency authority, and *Trump v. CASA* (2025) ending universal injunctions.

- **Multiple reform bills** have been introduced in Congress, including the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act (S. 359, 118th Congress), the Supreme Court Term Limits and Regular Appointments Act, and the Judiciary Act (court expansion). None have advanced past committee.

- **Gallup polling** from September 2024 shows Supreme Court approval at 43%, down from 62% in 2000. A 2023 Marquette Law School poll found 66% of Americans support a binding code of ethics for justices.

### [+] Clarence Thomas: Undisclosed Gifts and Travel

#### The ProPublica Investigation

Beginning in April 2023, ProPublica published a series of investigative reports documenting decades of undisclosed gifts received by Justice Clarence Thomas from Harlan Crow, a Dallas billionaire real estate developer and Republican megadonor.

**Key revelations:**

**Luxury Travel (2004-2023):**
- Thomas accepted at least **38 destination vacations** funded by Crow, including trips on Crow's private yacht (*Michaela Rose*, a 162-foot superyacht) and private jet (a Bombardier Global 5000).
- Destinations included Indonesia, the Greek islands, the Bohemian Grove in Northern California, the Adirondacks, and Crow's private resort in East Texas.
- ProPublica estimated the travel alone at **over $2.4 million** in value based on comparable private charter rates.
- Thomas did not disclose any of this travel on his annual financial disclosure forms, as required by the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. app. Sections 101-111).

[source: ProPublica - Clarence Thomas and the Billionaire (April 6, 2023)](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-trips-gifts-crow)

**Real Estate Transaction:**
- In 2014, Crow purchased Thomas's mother's house in Savannah, Georgia, along with two adjacent lots, for a combined **$133,363**. Thomas's mother continued living in the home rent-free.
- Crow then invested approximately **$36,000** in renovations to the property.
- Thomas did not disclose this transaction on his financial disclosure forms.
- Legal ethics experts told ProPublica this transaction should have been reported as either a gift or a real property transaction.

[source: ProPublica - Thomas Real Estate Deal (April 13, 2023)](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-real-estate-deal)

**Private School Tuition:**
- Crow paid private school tuition for Thomas's grandnephew Mark Martin, whom Thomas was raising, at two boarding schools: **Hidden Lake Academy** in Georgia and **Randolph-Macon Academy** in Virginia.
- Total estimated tuition payments: approximately **$150,000** over multiple years.
- Thomas did not disclose these payments on his financial disclosure forms.

[source: ProPublica - Thomas Tuition Payments (May 4, 2023)](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-private-school-tuition)

**RV Loan and Purchase:**
- In 1999, Crow and two other wealthy friends provided Thomas with a **$267,230** loan to purchase a Prevost Marathon luxury motorcoach.
- Thomas reported the loan on his 1999 disclosure but subsequently stopped reporting it. The debt appeared to be forgiven -- which, if so, would constitute taxable income and a reportable gift.
- Thomas later amended his disclosures to include a notation about the loan but provided minimal details.

[source: Senate Judiciary Committee Letter to Harlan Crow (May 2023)](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/dem/releases/judiciary-committee-demands-answers-from-harlan-crow)

**Thomas's Responses:**
- Thomas initially stated he was advised that "hospitality from close personal friends" did not need to be reported.
- In January 2024, Thomas filed **amended financial disclosures** covering multiple years, disclosing some previously unreported trips and gifts.
- Thomas's amended disclosures still did not account for all gifts identified by ProPublica.
- The Judicial Conference referred the matter to the Judicial Council of the D.C. Circuit, which declined to take action, citing lack of jurisdiction over Supreme Court justices.

[source: Thomas Amended Financial Disclosures (January 2024) - U.S. Office of Government Ethics](https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/C8B9E846BCBD0BA985258A2C0026FC87?OpenDocument)

#### Harlan Crow's Interests Before the Court

- Crow is a major donor to conservative organizations that file amicus briefs before the Supreme Court, including the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution.
- Crow has funded organizations that were parties in cases before the Court, though Crow himself has not been a named party.
- Ethics experts note that the pattern of gift-giving creates, at minimum, the **appearance of impropriety** regardless of whether direct quid pro quo can be established.

### [+] Samuel Alito: Ethics Controversies

#### The Alaska Fishing Trip

In June 2023, ProPublica reported that Justice Alito took a luxury fishing trip to a remote Alaska lodge in July 2008, flown there on a private jet arranged by hedge fund billionaire **Paul Singer**.

**Key facts:**
- The trip was to the **King Salmon Lodge** in southwestern Alaska.
- Transportation was on a private jet that ProPublica estimated would have cost over **$100,000** to charter.
- Singer's hedge fund, **Elliott Management**, was the primary litigant in *Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital*, which came before the Supreme Court in 2014.
- Alito **did not recuse** himself and voted in **Singer's favor** in a 7-1 decision.
- Alito did not disclose the trip on his financial disclosure forms.

[source: ProPublica - Alito and the Billionaire (June 20, 2023)](https://www.propublica.org/article/samuel-alito-luxury-fishing-trip-singer-supreme-court)

**Alito's Response:**
- Alito took the extraordinary step of publishing a **pre-emptive op-ed** in the Wall Street Journal the day before ProPublica's story ran, defending himself.
- He argued that the seat on the plane would have been empty anyway, so it had "no value" and did not need to be reported.
- He stated he had "no idea" Singer had business before the Court at the time of the trip.
- Ethics experts widely rejected these arguments, noting that the Ethics in Government Act requires disclosure of gifts of transportation regardless of whether the seat would have been otherwise empty.

#### The Flag Controversies

**Upside-Down American Flag (January 2021):**
- In January 2021, an upside-down American flag was displayed at Alito's Alexandria, Virginia home.
- An inverted flag is a recognized signal of distress and was widely adopted by supporters of the "Stop the Steal" movement following the January 6, 2021 Capitol breach.
- The flag was displayed during the period between January 6 and January 20, 2021 -- a period in which the Court was receiving emergency petitions related to the 2020 election.
- Alito attributed the display to his wife, **Martha-Ann Alito**, stating she raised it in response to a neighborhood dispute involving vulgar signage directed at their family.

[source: New York Times - Alito Flag Report (May 16, 2024)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/justice-alito-inverted-flag.html)

**"Appeal to Heaven" Flag (Summer 2023):**
- A second controversial flag, the "Appeal to Heaven" pine tree flag, was photographed flying at Alito's vacation home in Long Beach Island, New Jersey in the summer of 2023.
- This historical flag had been adopted by Christian nationalist groups and January 6 participants as a symbol.
- Alito again attributed the display to his wife.

[source: New York Times - Alito Second Flag (May 22, 2024)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/us/politics/alito-appeal-to-heaven-flag.html)

**Recusal Implications:**
- Following these revelations, Democratic members of Congress called for Alito to recuse from January 6-related cases.
- Alito issued a **public letter** declining to recuse, stating the flags were his wife's decision and did not reflect his views.
- He participated in *Trump v. United States* (2024), the presidential immunity case, and in *Fischer v. United States* (2024), which narrowed the obstruction statute used to prosecute January 6 defendants.

[source: Alito Letter Declining Recusal (June 2024)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/letter_alito_060524.pdf)

#### Leaked Recordings

- In June 2024, documentary filmmaker **Lauren Windsor** released secretly recorded conversations with both Alito and his wife at a Supreme Court Historical Society dinner.
- In the recordings, Alito appeared to agree with Windsor's suggestion that "people of faith" should "return our country to a place of godliness."
- Martha-Ann Alito was recorded making more explicit statements about her desire to fly flags and resist what she characterized as attacks on conservative values.

### [+] The Toothless Ethics Code

#### What Happened

On **November 13, 2023**, the Supreme Court released its first-ever code of conduct, titled "Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States."

This was a direct response to the ProPublica revelations about Thomas and Alito. Before this, the Supreme Court was the **only branch of the federal government** without a binding ethics code.

**What the code says:**
- Justices should avoid the appearance of impropriety.
- Justices should not accept gifts that would influence their judgment.
- Justices should recuse from cases where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned.
- The code largely mirrors the Code of Conduct for United States Judges (which applies to lower federal courts).

**What the code lacks:**
- **No enforcement mechanism** -- no body to investigate complaints.
- **No penalties** for violations -- no sanctions, fines, or consequences.
- **No independent investigation** -- justices decide for themselves whether they have violated the code.
- **No complaint process** -- there is no way for the public to file an ethics complaint against a justice.
- **Self-policing only** -- each justice individually decides whether to recuse or disclose.

[source: Supreme Court Code of Conduct (November 13, 2023)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/Code-of-Conduct-for-Justices_November_13_2023.pdf)

#### Comparison to Other Judges

**Lower federal judges** are bound by:
- The **Code of Conduct for United States Judges** (binding, enforced by the Judicial Conference).
- **28 U.S.C. Section 455** -- mandatory recusal standards.
- The **Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980** -- allows complaints to be filed against judges, investigated by circuit judicial councils, and can result in reprimand, censure, or referral to the House for impeachment.
- **Financial disclosure requirements** enforced by the Judicial Conference with referral to the DOJ for violations.

**Supreme Court justices** are subject to:
- The new voluntary code (no enforcement).
- Financial disclosure under the Ethics in Government Act (enforcement limited).
- Impeachment by Congress (the only constitutional remedy, requiring a two-thirds Senate vote).

#### Legislative Efforts

**The Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act (S. 359, 118th Congress):**
- Introduced by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI).
- Would require the Court to adopt a binding ethics code.
- Would create an enforcement mechanism through the Judicial Conference.
- Would require justices to explain recusal decisions publicly.
- Would strengthen financial disclosure requirements.
- Passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote in July 2023.
- Never received a full Senate vote.

### [+] Recusal Failures

#### Thomas and January 6 Cases

**The Conflict:**
- Justice Thomas's wife, **Virginia "Ginni" Thomas**, was actively involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.
- Between November 2020 and January 2021, Ginni Thomas sent **29 text messages** to White House Chief of Staff **Mark Meadows** urging him to challenge the election results.
- Sample messages included: "Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!!" and "Do not concede. It takes time for the army who is gathering for his back."
- Ginni Thomas also emailed **Arizona state legislators** urging them to appoint alternative electors.
- Ginni Thomas attended the rally on January 6, 2021 (though she stated she left before the Capitol breach).
- She testified before the House January 6 Committee in September 2022.

[source: January 6 Committee Transcripts - Ginni Thomas Interview (September 2022)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000083786/pdf/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000083786.pdf)

**Thomas's Participation in Related Cases:**
- Thomas was the **sole dissenter** in *Trump v. Thompson* (January 2022), voting to block the January 6 Committee from obtaining White House records -- records that later revealed his wife's communications with Meadows.
- Thomas participated in *Trump v. United States* (2024), the presidential immunity case directly related to prosecution arising from January 6 events.
- Thomas wrote a concurrence going further than the majority, arguing the special counsel's appointment was itself unconstitutional.
- **28 U.S.C. Section 455(a)** requires recusal when a judge's "impartiality might reasonably be questioned." Ethics experts across the political spectrum argued Thomas's wife's involvement created exactly this situation.

[source: Trump v. Thompson, 595 U.S. ___ (2022)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a272_9p6b.pdf)

#### Alito: Argentina v. NML Capital

- As documented above, Alito participated in *Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital* (2014) despite having accepted a luxury fishing trip from Paul Singer, whose hedge fund Elliott Management was the primary party in the case.
- Alito voted in Singer's favor.
- Under 28 U.S.C. Section 455(a), recusal is required where a judge's "impartiality might reasonably be questioned."

[source: Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital, 573 U.S. 134 (2014)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-842_5hdk.pdf)

#### Other Recusal Concerns

- **Justice Neil Gorsuch** sold a Colorado property to the CEO of the law firm **Greenberg Traurig** within two weeks of his confirmation to the Court in 2017. The property had been on the market for two years and sold quickly. Greenberg Traurig subsequently had cases before the Court. Gorsuch did not recuse from cases involving the firm.

### [+] The Federalist Society Pipeline

#### What Is the Federalist Society?

The **Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies** is a conservative and libertarian legal organization founded in 1982 at Yale Law School, the University of Chicago, and Harvard Law School. It describes its purpose as promoting "originalist" and "textualist" interpretations of the Constitution.

**Key facts:**
- Membership exceeds **90,000** lawyers, law students, and legal scholars.
- The organization has chapters at all accredited law schools in the United States.
- It operates with an annual budget exceeding **$25 million**.
- It does not directly litigate cases but serves as a professional network and intellectual pipeline for conservative legal thought.

#### Leonard Leo and Judicial Selection

**Leonard Leo** served as Executive Vice President of the Federalist Society from 1995 to 2020. During that period, he became the most influential figure in conservative judicial nominations.

**Leo's role in Supreme Court nominations:**
- Leo took leaves of absence from the Federalist Society to advise Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump on Supreme Court nominations.
- He was directly involved in the selection of **John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh**, and **Amy Coney Barrett**.
- During the Trump administration, Leo helped compile the public list of potential Supreme Court nominees from which all three Trump picks were selected.

[source: Washington Post - Leonard Leo Profile (January 2019)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/leonard-leo-federalists-society-courts/)

**Dark Money:**
- In August 2022, Chicago industrialist **Barre Seid** donated **$1.6 billion** to a nonprofit controlled by Leonard Leo -- the **Marble Freedom Trust** -- the largest known political advocacy donation in U.S. history.
- This donation was structured as a transfer of stock (Tripp Lite) to a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, avoiding capital gains taxes.
- Leo's network of nonprofits channels funding to judicial advocacy organizations, amicus brief campaigns, and judicial confirmation battles.
- The network is deliberately opaque: money flows through multiple layers of 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) nonprofits, making the ultimate donors difficult to trace.

[source: New York Times - $1.6 Billion Donation to Leo (August 22, 2022)](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/22/us/politics/republican-dark-money.html)

#### Federalist Society Justices on the Current Court

| Justice | Appointed By | Federalist Society Connection |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Clarence Thomas | G.H.W. Bush (1991) | Long-standing member and speaker |
| John Roberts | G.W. Bush (2005) | Listed in early directories; later distanced himself |
| Samuel Alito | G.W. Bush (2006) | Regular speaker at Federalist Society events |
| Neil Gorsuch | Trump (2017) | Selected from Federalist Society-influenced list |
| Brett Kavanaugh | Trump (2018) | Selected from Federalist Society-influenced list |
| Amy Coney Barrett | Trump (2020) | Member; spoke at Federalist Society events |

[source: Federalist Society Member Directories and Event Records](https://fedsoc.org/contributors)

#### The Impact on the Judiciary

- As of 2025, approximately **one-third of all active federal judges** were appointed by Trump, many from Federalist Society-vetted lists.
- During the Trump administration (2017-2021), **234 federal judges** were confirmed, including 3 Supreme Court justices, 54 appellate judges, and 174 district judges.
- The Federalist Society's influence extends beyond nominations: its network of lawyers provides amicus briefs, legal strategy, and intellectual framing for cases before the courts.

### [+] Key Partisan Rulings

#### Trump v. United States (2024) -- Presidential Immunity

- **Decision:** The Court ruled 6-3 that former presidents enjoy **presumptive immunity** from criminal prosecution for acts within the "outer perimeter" of official duties, and **absolute immunity** for core constitutional powers.
- **Impact:** Effectively delayed federal criminal prosecution of Donald Trump past the 2024 election and created a new constitutional doctrine.
- **Dissent:** Justice Sotomayor wrote that the decision "makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of Government, that no man is above the law."

[source: Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. ___ (2024)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf)

#### Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024) -- Chevron Overturned

- **Decision:** The Court ruled 6-3 to overturn **Chevron v. NRDC** (1984), ending 40 years of judicial deference to federal agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes.
- **Impact:** Courts, rather than expert agencies, now decide what ambiguous laws mean, weakening the regulatory state across every policy area.
- **Significance:** Chevron was cited in over 18,000 federal court decisions.

[source: Loper Bright v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. ___ (2024)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf)

#### Trump v. CASA (2025) -- Universal Injunctions Ended

- **Decision:** Federal courts can no longer issue nationwide injunctions blocking government policies. Courts can only protect specific parties before them.
- **Impact:** Dramatically increases the burden on civil rights organizations, which must now recruit individual plaintiffs in every jurisdiction.

[source: Trump v. CASA de Maryland (2025)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24-813_lkgn.pdf)

#### Dobbs v. Jackson (2022)

- **Decision:** The Court ruled 6-3 to overturn **Roe v. Wade** (1973), eliminating the constitutional right to abortion after 49 years.
- **Impact:** Triggered bans in over 20 states. First time the Court revoked a previously recognized individual right.

[source: Dobbs v. Jackson, 597 U.S. 215 (2022)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf)

#### Fischer v. United States (2024)

- **Decision:** The Court ruled 6-3 that the obstruction statute (18 U.S.C. 1512(c)(2)) applies only to evidence impairment, not broader obstruction of proceedings.
- **Impact:** Narrowed the most serious charge against January 6 defendants, affecting 300+ cases.

[source: Fischer v. United States, 603 U.S. ___ (2024)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-5572_2c83.pdf)

#### Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (2023)

- **Decision:** The Court ruled 6-3 that race-conscious admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause.
- **Impact:** Ended affirmative action in college admissions nationwide.

[source: SFFA v. Harvard, 600 U.S. 181 (2023)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf)

#### Pattern of 6-3 Decisions

In each of these cases, the six justices appointed by Republican presidents voted together against the three appointed by Democratic presidents. This consistent ideological alignment on the most consequential cases has fueled concerns about the Court's institutional legitimacy.

### [+] Financial Disclosures

#### The Current System

Supreme Court justices must file annual financial disclosures under the **Ethics in Government Act of 1978** (5 U.S.C. app. Sections 101-111).

**What must be disclosed:**
- Income from all sources
- Assets and liabilities over $1,000
- Gifts valued over the reporting threshold
- Reimbursements for travel and lodging
- Real property transactions
- Positions held in organizations

**What is NOT effectively enforced:**
- There is **no audit** of justices' disclosures.
- The **Judicial Conference** has limited enforcement authority over Supreme Court justices.
- No penalty has ever been imposed for incomplete disclosures.

[source: Ethics in Government Act](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title5/titleAppendix/node6&edition=prelim)

#### The "Personal Hospitality" Loophole

- Until 2023, justices could accept "personal hospitality" without disclosure.
- Thomas used this to justify not reporting decades of Crow-funded travel.
- In March 2023, the Judicial Conference tightened the rule prospectively.

[source: Judicial Conference Rules Update (March 2023)](https://www.uscourts.gov/rules-policies/judiciary-policies/ethics-policies)

#### Comparison to Other Branches

| Branch | Disclosure | Enforcement | Consequences |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Congress** | Annual disclosures; STOCK Act | Congressional Ethics; DOJ | Fines, censure, prosecution |
| **Executive** | SF-278 disclosures | Office of Government Ethics | Removal, prosecution |
| **Supreme Court** | Annual disclosures | Judicial Conference (limited) | Referral to AG (never used) |

### [+] Cases to Watch

#### 2025-2026 Term

**Challenges to Federal Agency Authority:**
- Multiple cases testing post-Chevron boundaries
- Challenges to SEC, EPA, and FTC enforcement
- Each weakens federal agencies' ability to enforce law

**Immigration Enforcement Cases:**
- Expedited removal and asylum restriction challenges
- Tests of Trump v. CASA injunction limits

**Second Amendment Cases:**
- Ongoing challenges testing the *Bruen* framework

## Analysis

The facts above document an institution in crisis -- not from any single scandal, but from a structural failure to hold its members accountable to the ethical standards applied to every other federal judge.

### [+] What This Means

#### A Legitimacy Crisis

The Supreme Court's authority rests on **institutional legitimacy** -- public acceptance that its decisions reflect impartial legal reasoning rather than political preferences.

That legitimacy is eroding:
- **Public trust at historic lows.** Only 43% approval (Gallup, September 2024), down from 62% in 2000.
- **Perceived partisanship.** Consistent 6-3 ideological splits on the most consequential cases.
- **Ethics without accountability.** The voluntary code reinforced the perception that justices are above the rules governing all other judges.
- **Gifts without consequence.** $4+ million in documented undisclosed gifts with no investigation or penalty.

#### The Structural Problem

The Constitution provides only one accountability mechanism: **impeachment** (House majority + Senate two-thirds vote). This is effectively impossible in the current political environment, meaning:
- Justices can accept millions in gifts without consequence.
- Justices can refuse to recuse despite clear conflicts without consequence.
- Justices can display partisan symbols while ruling on related cases without consequence.

#### Impact on Rights

- **Women** lost a 49-year-old constitutional right (*Dobbs*).
- **Regulatory protections** weakened across environmental, health, and safety domains (*Loper Bright*).
- **Presidential accountability** dramatically reduced (*Trump v. United States*).
- **Civil rights plaintiffs** must recruit individual parties in every jurisdiction (*Trump v. CASA*).

### [+] Court Reform Options

#### Option 1: Enforceable Ethics Code
- Binding code with independent investigation and consequences.
- **Current bill:** Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act (S. 359).
- 64-66% public support. Most politically achievable.

[source: S. 359](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/359)

#### Option 2: Term Limits
- 18-year fixed terms; 2 appointments per presidential term.
- **Current bill:** Supreme Court Term Limits and Regular Appointments Act.
- 60-70% bipartisan support. May require constitutional amendment.

#### Option 3: Court Expansion
- Increase from 9 to 13 justices. Congress has changed the number 7 times.
- **Current bill:** Judiciary Act (Sen. Ed Markey, Rep. Hank Johnson).
- Requires only legislation, not amendment. Politically controversial.

[source: Judiciary Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1141)

#### Option 4: Jurisdiction Stripping
- Limit appellate jurisdiction under Article III, Section 2.
- Constitutional basis exists but unprecedented in modern practice.

### [+] The Broader Judicial Strategy

#### Beyond the Supreme Court

- **Lower courts:** 234 federal judges confirmed in Trump's first term, including 54 appellate judges. Many under 45, serving for decades.
- **Federalist Society pipeline** extends throughout the entire judiciary.
- **State courts** targeted through RAGA and RSLC campaign funding.
- **Amicus briefs:** Dark money organizations generate both the judges and the legal arguments they hear.

#### Long-term Consequences

The conservative supermajority will likely persist for decades:
- Thomas (76) and Alito (74) are the oldest conservatives; if they retire under a Republican president, younger replacements follow.
- Gorsuch (57), Kavanaugh (59), and Barrett (52) could serve 20-30 more years.
- The three liberal justices would need Democratic replacement to maintain even the current 6-3 minority.
