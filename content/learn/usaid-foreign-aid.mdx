# The End of USAID & American Foreign Aid

## Quick Summary

The Trump administration has effectively dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), firing the vast majority of its workforce, freezing billions in congressionally appropriated foreign aid, and halting programs that provided lifesaving HIV treatment to over 20 million people, food assistance to tens of millions, and maternal health care across 120+ countries. Federal courts have ordered the administration to reinstate employees and resume programs, but compliance has been limited. Constitutional scholars argue the aid freeze violates the Impoundment Control Act by withholding funds Congress legally appropriated and directed to be spent.

## Facts

### Key Points

- **PEPFAR treatment interrupted:** Over 20 million people worldwide receiving lifesaving antiretroviral HIV/AIDS treatment through PEPFAR face treatment interruption; medical experts warn that stopping antiretroviral therapy leads to viral rebound, drug resistance, and death
- **Workforce gutted:** USAID's workforce of approximately 10,000 employees was slashed by roughly 80-90%, with mass firings, reduction in force actions, and placed-on-leave orders eliminating career staff and institutional expertise built over 60+ years
- **Billions in aid frozen:** The administration froze virtually all foreign assistance disbursements, affecting programs across 100+ countries, despite Congress having appropriated the funds
- **Food programs halted:** USAID was the world's largest provider of emergency food assistance, feeding tens of millions annually; program freezes put populations in famine-risk regions at acute danger
- **DOGE involvement:** Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gained access to USAID systems, with young DOGE staffers given authority over career officials and access to sensitive program data
- **Courts ordered reinstatement:** Multiple federal judges ordered USAID to reinstate fired employees and resume operations, but the administration has been slow to comply or has openly resisted court orders
- **Impoundment question:** Legal experts argue withholding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds violates the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which prohibits the president from unilaterally refusing to spend money Congress has directed be spent
- **Bipartisan program destroyed:** USAID was created by President Kennedy in 1961 and PEPFAR was created by President George W. Bush in 2003; both had longstanding bipartisan support

### [+] What USAID Does (Did)

**Agency Overview:**

The United States Agency for International Development was established by President John F. Kennedy through Executive Order 10973 on November 3, 1961, consolidating existing foreign assistance programs into a single agency. For over six decades, USAID served as the primary U.S. government agency responsible for administering civilian foreign aid and development assistance.

**Scale of Operations (Pre-Dismantling):**

- Operated in **100+ countries** worldwide
- Annual budget of approximately **$28-40 billion** (FY2024 enacted: approximately $28.4 billion for the State Department and USAID combined through regular appropriations; total including supplemental and emergency funds was higher)
- Employed approximately **10,000 direct-hire staff** (about 4,000 U.S. direct hires and 6,000 Foreign Service nationals)
- Managed **thousands of implementing partner contracts** with NGOs, universities, and private firms
- Coordinated with partner governments, multilateral organizations, and civil society worldwide

**Major Program Areas:**

- **Global Health:** HIV/AIDS treatment (PEPFAR), malaria prevention (President's Malaria Initiative), tuberculosis treatment, maternal and child health, family planning, nutrition, pandemic preparedness
- **Food Security:** Emergency food assistance, Feed the Future agricultural development, famine early warning systems (FEWS NET)
- **Democracy and Governance:** Election monitoring, anti-corruption programs, judicial reform, civil society support, media freedom programs
- **Education:** Basic and higher education in developing countries, literacy programs, teacher training
- **Economic Growth:** Trade capacity building, financial sector development, private enterprise support
- **Humanitarian Assistance:** Disaster response, refugee assistance, conflict mitigation
- **Water and Sanitation:** Clean water access programs serving millions

**USAID's Impact by the Numbers (Cumulative Achievements):**

- **PEPFAR** (since 2003): Provided antiretroviral therapy to **20+ million people**, saved an estimated **25 million lives**, prevented millions of HIV infections, supported **5.5 million orphans and vulnerable children**
- **President's Malaria Initiative** (since 2005): Contributed to a **60% decline in malaria mortality** in target countries across sub-Saharan Africa
- **Feed the Future** (since 2010): Helped lift **23.4 million people out of poverty** and **5.2 million children from stunting** in target zones
- **Maternal/Child Health:** Contributed to a **50% reduction in under-5 child mortality** globally from 2000-2020 through vaccination, nutrition, and care programs
- **Family Planning:** Helped **48 million women and girls** gain access to modern contraception annually

### [+] The Dismantling: What Happened

**Phase 1: The Foreign Aid Freeze (January-February 2025)**

On January 20, 2025, Inauguration Day, the Trump administration issued executive orders pausing all foreign development assistance pending a review. On January 24, 2025, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memo directing federal agencies to pause all grants and loans, which included foreign aid.

On January 27, 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a stop-work order on virtually all existing foreign assistance, directing that nearly all USAID-managed programs halt operations immediately. Implementing partners were told to stop work, send staff home, and cease all disbursements.

[source: Implementing the President's Executive Order on Foreign Aid](https://www.state.gov/implementing-the-presidents-executive-order-on-reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/)

**Phase 2: DOGE Arrives at USAID (February 2025)**

In early February 2025, operatives from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) arrived at USAID headquarters in Washington, D.C. Reports indicated that young DOGE staff members, some in their twenties with minimal government experience, were given access to USAID's financial systems, personnel records, and program databases.

DOGE personnel reportedly:
- Gained access to classified and sensitive program information
- Reviewed contracts and grants for cancellation
- Directed staff reassignments and terminations
- Asserted authority over career Senior Executive Service (SES) officials
- Accessed systems containing personal data on staff and foreign partners, raising security concerns

Career USAID officials raised alarms that DOGE staffers lacked appropriate security clearances for the sensitive information they were accessing, including intelligence-related programs and the identities of foreign partners in authoritarian countries who could face retaliation.

[source: USAID Security Leaders Removed After Refusing DOGE Access](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/usaid-security-leaders-removed-refusing-elon-musks-doge-employees-acce-rcna190357)

**Phase 3: Mass Firings and Reduction in Force (February-April 2025)**

Beginning in February 2025, the administration initiated waves of firings and administrative actions targeting USAID staff:

- **February 2025:** Approximately 2,000+ USAID employees were placed on administrative leave or given termination notices, including career Foreign Service officers with decades of experience
- **Reduction in Force (RIF):** Formal RIF notices were sent to thousands of USAID employees, many of them career civil servants protected by federal employment law
- **Probationary employees:** Workers still in their probationary period were fired en masse with minimal notice
- **Foreign Service Nationals:** Locally-employed staff in overseas missions faced termination, severing decades-long partnerships and institutional knowledge
- **Senior leadership purged:** Career ambassadors, mission directors, and senior officials were removed or reassigned

By spring 2025, estimates indicated that **80-90% of USAID's direct-hire workforce had been terminated, placed on leave, or pushed to resign**, reducing the agency from approximately 10,000 employees to a skeleton crew of roughly 1,000-2,000.

**Phase 4: Absorption into the State Department (March 2025)**

In late February 2025, the administration announced plans to fold remaining USAID functions into the State Department, effectively dissolving USAID as an independent agency. Secretary Rubio was given authority over the remaining USAID functions.

An executive order signed in March 2025 directed the reorganization of USAID, transferring its authorities and remaining personnel to the State Department. Critics argued this:
- Violated the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which established USAID as an independent agency reporting to the President and Secretary of State but maintaining operational independence
- Required congressional authorization that was never sought
- Destroyed the deliberate separation between diplomacy (State) and development (USAID) that had existed since 1961

[source: EO 14238: Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/20/2025-04868/continuing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy)

**Phase 5: Program Terminations**

By spring 2025, the scale of program cancellations became clear:
- **PEPFAR programs:** Contracts and grants paused, then many terminated outright
- **Feed the Future:** Agricultural development programs halted in 20+ target countries
- **Democracy programs:** Election monitoring, anti-corruption, and civil society programs terminated
- **Maternal health:** Programs providing prenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and family planning cancelled
- **Education:** Literacy and schooling programs for millions of children ended
- **Disaster response:** Humanitarian assistance pipelines disrupted during active crises

### [+] PEPFAR & HIV/AIDS Programs

**What PEPFAR Is:**

The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) was launched by President George W. Bush in 2003 as the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease internationally. It has been widely considered one of the most successful U.S. foreign policy initiatives in history, with bipartisan reauthorization under Presidents Bush, Obama, Trump (first term), and Biden.

[source: PEPFAR Results and Impact](https://www.state.gov/results-and-impact-pepfar)

**PEPFAR by the Numbers (Pre-Disruption):**

| Metric | Figure |
|--------|--------|
| People on antiretroviral therapy (ART) | **20.1 million** |
| Estimated lives saved since 2003 | **25 million** |
| Countries with PEPFAR programs | **55** |
| Orphans and vulnerable children supported | **5.5 million** |
| HIV infections averted (estimated) | **5.5 million** |
| Babies born HIV-free to positive mothers | **5.5 million** |
| Annual PEPFAR budget (FY2024) | **~$7 billion** |

[source: PEPFAR Reports to Congress 2005-2022](https://www.state.gov/pepfar-reports-to-congress-2005-2022)

**What Happens When HIV Treatment Stops:**

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be taken continuously. When patients stop treatment:

1. **Viral rebound:** HIV viral load increases within days to weeks
2. **Immune suppression:** CD4 count drops, leaving patients vulnerable to opportunistic infections
3. **Drug resistance:** Interrupted treatment breeds drug-resistant HIV strains, making future treatment harder and more expensive
4. **Transmission:** Patients with high viral loads become infectious again, reversing the U=U (Undetectable = Untransmittable) achievement
5. **Death:** Without continued ART, most patients progress to AIDS and death within 1-3 years

[source: WHO HIV Treatment Guidelines](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240031593)

**Projected Impact of Treatment Interruption:**

Global health experts, including former PEPFAR coordinators and WHO officials, have warned that disruption of PEPFAR programs could lead to:

- **Hundreds of thousands to millions of deaths** among the 20+ million people currently on treatment if supply chains are permanently disrupted
- **New epidemics:** Drug-resistant HIV strains emerging from mass treatment interruption
- **Reversal of decades of progress:** Countries that achieved viral suppression could see HIV rates surge back to pre-PEPFAR levels
- **Mother-to-child transmission:** Prevention programs ending means thousands of babies born HIV-positive who would otherwise have been born free of the virus
- **Orphan crisis:** Children who lost parents to AIDS before PEPFAR would lose the support systems PEPFAR built

The ONE Campaign estimated that a full cessation of PEPFAR could result in **7-8 million additional deaths** over the following years if treatment is permanently cut off.

**Country-Specific Impacts:**

| Country | People on PEPFAR-Supported ART | Risk Level |
|---------|-------------------------------|------------|
| South Africa | ~5.5 million | Extreme - largest program globally |
| Mozambique | ~1.9 million | Extreme - PEPFAR is primary provider |
| Tanzania | ~1.7 million | Extreme - limited alternative funding |
| Kenya | ~1.4 million | Very High |
| Uganda | ~1.3 million | Very High |
| Nigeria | ~1.2 million | Extreme - already struggling health system |
| Zimbabwe | ~1.1 million | Extreme - few alternative sources |
| Zambia | ~1.0 million | Very High |
| Malawi | ~900,000 | Extreme - among world's poorest nations |
| Ethiopia | ~700,000 | Extreme - concurrent humanitarian crises |

### [+] Global Food Security Programs

**Feed the Future:**

Feed the Future, the U.S. Government's global hunger and food security initiative, was launched in 2010 and operated in **20+ target countries**, primarily in Africa and Asia. USAID was the lead implementing agency.

**Results before disruption:**
- Helped **23.4 million people** out of poverty in target zones
- Reduced stunting in **5.2 million children**
- Generated **$26.2 billion** in agricultural sales by smallholder farmers
- Trained millions of farmers in improved techniques
- Developed drought-resistant crop varieties

[source: Feed the Future Results Dashboard](https://www.feedthefuture.gov/results/)

**USAID Emergency Food Assistance:**

USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance was the **world's largest provider of emergency food assistance**, operating in crisis zones including:

- **Horn of Africa:** Responding to recurring drought and famine affecting 20+ million people
- **Yemen:** Supporting populations in the world's worst humanitarian crisis
- **South Sudan:** Providing food to millions displaced by civil war
- **Syria:** Cross-border and in-country food distribution
- **Afghanistan:** Emergency feeding programs after the Taliban takeover
- **Ukraine:** Food assistance following Russia's invasion

**Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET):**

USAID funded and operated FEWS NET, the world's premier famine early warning system, which provided:
- Advance warning of food crises in 36 countries
- Food security data used by the UN, World Bank, and partner governments
- Analysis enabling preemptive action before famines develop
- The freeze disrupted FEWS NET operations at a critical time

[source: FEWS NET](https://fews.net/)

**Impact of Food Program Freezes:**

The World Food Programme (WFP) and partner organizations warned that the disruption of USAID food assistance:
- Leaves **tens of millions** without access to emergency food supplies
- Disrupts supply chains that take months to rebuild
- Hits during active famine conditions in multiple regions
- Removes the single largest donor from the global food security system (the U.S. provided approximately **40-50% of global humanitarian food assistance**)
- Exacerbates food crises already worsened by climate change, conflict, and economic disruption

---

### [+] Democracy and Governance Programs

**What Was Defunded:**

USAID's democracy and governance programs represented approximately $2.7 billion annually and included:

- **Election monitoring:** Supporting independent election observation in countries transitioning to or maintaining democracy
- **Anti-corruption programs:** Building transparent institutions, supporting investigative journalism, training prosecutors and judges
- **Civil society support:** Funding independent media, human rights organizations, and civic groups in authoritarian and transitional countries
- **Rule of law programs:** Judicial reform, legal aid, constitutional development
- **Legislative strengthening:** Building parliamentary capacity in new democracies

**Programs Terminated or Suspended:**

- Election observation support in **dozens of countries** holding elections in 2025-2026
- Anti-corruption assistance in **Ukraine** at a critical moment during the ongoing war
- Media freedom programs in countries where independent journalism is under threat
- Human rights monitoring in authoritarian states
- Civil society support in countries where U.S.-funded programs were the primary external support for democratic movements

**Strategic Implications:**

Former diplomats and national security officials from both parties warned that ending democracy programs:
- Creates a vacuum that **China and Russia** are actively filling with their own influence programs
- Abandons human rights defenders who relied on U.S. partnership, potentially putting their lives at risk
- Undermines the credibility of U.S. claims to support freedom and democracy worldwide
- Removes early warning systems for political instability that could affect U.S. interests

---

### [+] Maternal and Child Health Programs

**Programs Cut:**

USAID maternal and child health programs reached **millions of women and children** annually:

- **Maternal Health:** Prenatal care, skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care, postpartum support in 30+ countries
- **Child Survival:** Immunization, oral rehydration therapy, nutrition supplementation, treatment of childhood illnesses
- **Family Planning and Reproductive Health:** Access to modern contraception for **48 million women and girls** annually, reducing unintended pregnancies and maternal deaths
- **Nutrition:** Programs addressing stunting, wasting, and micronutrient deficiency in children under 5

**Estimated Impact of Cuts:**

Health policy researchers estimated that halting USAID maternal and child health programs could result in:

- **Tens of thousands of additional maternal deaths** annually in countries where USAID was a primary funder of safe motherhood programs
- **Hundreds of thousands of additional child deaths** from preventable causes including malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia, and malnutrition
- **Millions of unintended pregnancies** from loss of family planning access
- Reversal of decades of progress in reducing global maternal and infant mortality

The Guttmacher Institute estimated that the reinstatement and expansion of the Global Gag Rule (Mexico City Policy), which predated the USAID dismantling but was amplified by it, could result in **millions of additional unintended pregnancies** and **thousands of additional maternal deaths** annually.

---

### [+] Congressional Authority & Impoundment

**The Constitutional Question:**

The U.S. Constitution vests the power of the purse in Congress (Article I, Section 9). Congress appropriated specific funds for foreign assistance programs through annual appropriations bills, continuing resolutions, and supplemental spending measures. The president's authority to spend or withhold those funds is constrained by law.

**The Impoundment Control Act of 1974:**

Following President Nixon's impoundment of congressionally appropriated funds, Congress passed the Impoundment Control Act (ICA) as part of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-344). The law:

- **Prohibits the president** from unilaterally refusing to spend (impounding) funds Congress has appropriated
- Requires the president to submit a **rescission request** to Congress if he wants to cancel spending
- Congress has **45 legislative days** to approve rescissions; if Congress does not act, the funds must be released
- Allows only **temporary deferrals** of spending, and only for specific, limited reasons (not policy disagreements)

[source: Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974](https://www.congress.gov/bill/93rd-congress/house-bill/7130)

[source: GAO Impoundment Resources](https://www.gao.gov/legal/appropriations-law/impoundment-control)

**How the Aid Freeze May Violate the ICA:**

Legal scholars and former government officials have argued that the USAID aid freeze constitutes an illegal impoundment because:

1. **Congress appropriated the funds:** Annual and supplemental appropriations directed specific dollar amounts to foreign assistance programs
2. **No rescission request was submitted:** The administration did not follow the ICA process of requesting rescissions from Congress
3. **The freeze exceeds deferral authority:** Deferrals are permitted only for routine financial management, not policy objections
4. **Permanent cancellation without authorization:** Terminating programs and contracts effectively cancels spending Congress directed, without congressional approval

**Congressional Responses:**

Members of Congress from both parties raised objections to the aid freeze:
- The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings questioning the legality of the freeze
- Bipartisan letters were sent to the administration demanding restoration of funding
- Some members introduced legislation to mandate spending of appropriated foreign aid funds
- Appropriations Committee members publicly stated that the administration was defying congressional spending directives

However, congressional Republican leadership largely declined to take enforcement action against the impoundment, despite many GOP members having supported PEPFAR reauthorization in prior years.

---

### [+] Legal Challenges

**Major Lawsuits:**

Multiple lawsuits were filed challenging the USAID dismantling and foreign aid freeze:

**1. AFGE v. Trump (Federal Employee Unions)**
- **Filed by:** American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and other federal employee unions
- **Claims:** Mass firings violated the Federal Employees' Pay Act, Reduction in Force procedures, and due process protections
- **Court orders:** Federal judges issued temporary restraining orders requiring reinstatement of fired employees
- **Compliance:** The administration was slow to comply; judges issued strongly worded orders threatening contempt

**2. Global Health Organizations v. State Department**
- **Filed by:** Coalition of global health NGOs and implementing partners
- **Claims:** The stop-work orders violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and constituted illegal impoundment of congressionally appropriated funds
- **Status:** Courts issued injunctions requiring partial resumption of program activities

**3. Congressional Oversight Challenges**
- Members of Congress explored options for enforcing the Impoundment Control Act
- The GAO was asked to investigate whether the aid freeze constituted an illegal impoundment

**4. USAID Employees' Constitutional Claims**
- Career employees filed claims arguing their firings violated First Amendment protections, due process, and statutory protections under the Civil Service Reform Act

**Court Orders and Compliance:**

Multiple federal district judges ordered the administration to:
- Reinstate employees who were improperly fired
- Resume processing of grants and contracts
- Provide accounting of terminated programs
- Stop DOGE personnel from accessing sensitive systems without proper clearances

The administration's pattern of response to court orders drew judicial criticism, with judges noting slow compliance and the government arguing that USAID functions had been permanently transferred, making reinstatement moot.

---

### [+] Institutional Knowledge Destruction

**What Was Lost:**

The USAID dismantling represents a loss of institutional knowledge that took 60+ years to build:

**Expertise Destroyed:**
- **Area specialists:** Officers with decades of experience in specific countries, fluent in local languages, understanding political dynamics and cultural contexts
- **Technical experts:** Public health professionals, agricultural scientists, economists, engineers who designed and evaluated programs
- **Program managers:** Staff who understood complex contract structures, partner relationships, and regulatory requirements
- **Foreign Service Nationals (FSN):** Locally-hired staff in overseas missions who provided irreplaceable knowledge of local conditions and history, many with 20-30+ years of service

**Relationships Severed:**
- Partnerships with host governments built over decades
- Trust relationships with civil society organizations and community leaders
- Coordination networks with other donor governments and multilateral institutions
- Personal relationships between USAID officers and counterparts that enabled effective program delivery

**Why This Cannot Be Quickly Rebuilt:**

Former USAID administrators from both parties have stated that the institutional destruction cannot be reversed easily:
- Training a Foreign Service officer takes 5-10 years
- Building partner trust takes decades
- Program pipeline development requires years of planning
- Country-specific expertise is irreplaceable once lost
- Foreign Service Nationals who are terminated may never return

## Analysis

The dismantling of USAID represents one of the most consequential executive actions of the current administration. It is not merely a budget cut or policy shift. It is the destruction of an entire institution, its workforce, and the global infrastructure it supported.

### [+] What This Means

**Geopolitical Consequences:**

The United States has been the world's largest foreign aid donor for decades. USAID was a primary instrument of American soft power. The dismantling of USAID:

- **Creates a power vacuum** that China and Russia are actively seeking to fill. China's Belt and Road Initiative already outspends U.S. development assistance in many countries; the end of USAID removes the primary competitor.
- **Weakens U.S. alliances** by abandoning partner countries that relied on American development assistance.
- **Undermines U.S. national security** by removing programs that addressed root causes of instability, terrorism, and migration. The U.S. military has consistently testified that development assistance is essential for national security.
- **Destroys American credibility** as a reliable partner. Countries and organizations that aligned with U.S. priorities now face abandonment.

**Former military leaders**, including former Defense Secretaries and Combatant Commanders from both parties, have argued that every dollar spent on development assistance saves many dollars in military spending by preventing conflicts before they start.

**The Institutional Destruction:**

Unlike a policy that can be reversed by a future administration, the destruction of USAID's workforce and institutional knowledge creates damage that will take decades to repair:

- **Human capital:** Training Foreign Service officers takes years; institutional knowledge transfers only through mentorship
- **Partner relationships:** Trust, once broken, is extremely difficult to rebuild
- **Program pipelines:** Development programs take years to design, implement, and show results
- **Implementing partner ecosystem:** NGOs and contractors that depended on USAID funding are closing offices and losing their own institutional knowledge

### [+] Who's Affected

**Directly Affected Populations:**

- **20+ million HIV/AIDS patients** on PEPFAR-supported treatment face treatment interruption, drug resistance, and death
- **Tens of millions** receiving USAID-funded emergency food assistance face acute hunger and famine
- **48 million women and girls** who accessed family planning through USAID programs
- **Millions of children** receiving nutrition support, immunizations, and education
- **Populations in 55 PEPFAR countries** that built health systems around USAID support
- **Farmers in 20+ Feed the Future countries** who depended on technical assistance

**American Interests Affected:**

- **U.S. national security:** Loss of stability programs that prevent conflicts and migration
- **U.S. soft power:** Dramatic reduction in American influence in developing nations
- **U.S. health security:** USAID pandemic preparedness programs served as early warning systems for diseases that could reach the United States
- **American workers:** Approximately 10,000 USAID employees lost livelihoods
- **American taxpayers:** Congressionally appropriated funds not being spent for their intended purpose

**Countries Most Affected:**

Sub-Saharan Africa bears the heaviest burden, as the region receives the largest share of USAID assistance and has the least capacity to replace it. Countries in active crisis, including Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, and the Horn of Africa, face the most immediate humanitarian consequences.

### [+] The Human Cost

**Estimated Deaths from Treatment and Program Interruption:**

Global health researchers and organizations have produced estimates based on established epidemiological models:

- **HIV/AIDS:** If PEPFAR treatment for 20+ million people is permanently interrupted, mortality models suggest **hundreds of thousands to millions of deaths** in the following 1-5 years. The ONE Campaign estimated **7-8 million potential deaths** from full PEPFAR cessation.
- **Malaria:** Disruption of the President's Malaria Initiative could reverse a 60% decline in malaria deaths. Malaria kills approximately **600,000 people annually** (mostly children under 5).
- **Food insecurity:** Removing the world's largest emergency food donor during active famine conditions puts **tens of millions** at risk of acute malnutrition and starvation.
- **Maternal and child health:** Disruption could result in **tens of thousands of additional maternal deaths** and **hundreds of thousands of additional child deaths** annually.

**These are not hypothetical numbers.** They are based on known epidemiological data: what happens when HIV treatment stops, what happens when food aid is withdrawn from famine zones, what happens when vaccination programs are interrupted, and what happened in these regions before these programs existed.

The scale of potential loss of life from the USAID dismantling could ultimately exceed that of any single natural disaster in modern history.
