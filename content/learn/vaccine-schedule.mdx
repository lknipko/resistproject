# HHS Vaccine Schedule Changes: The Public Health Split

## Quick Summary

HHS reclassified six vaccines (COVID-19, flu, Hepatitis A/B, and others) from "routine" to "Shared Clinical Decision-Making," triggering state trigger laws that restrict pharmacist authority.

    The nation now operates under two public health regimes based on whether governors have issued emergency orders overriding federal guidance.

## Facts

### What Changed

**Vaccines Removed from "Routine" Recommendations:**

The following vaccines were reclassified from "routine" (recommended for all children) to "Shared Clinical Decision-Making" (recommended only for high-risk groups or after individual consultation):

1. COVID-19
2. Influenza (Flu)
3. Hepatitis A
4. Hepatitis B
5. Two additional childhood vaccines

**Process Bypassed:**

This decision bypassed the traditional scientific review process of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). The change was made by political appointees rather than the scientific body that has historically set vaccine recommendations.

### The Pharmacy Access Crisis

**State Laws Triggered:**

In 25 states, laws authorize pharmacists to administer vaccines **only if they are on the CDC's "routine" schedule**. When HHS removed these vaccines from the routine list:

- Pharmacists in those states immediately lost legal authority to administer them without a physician's prescription
- Rural areas where pharmacies are the primary healthcare access point were severely impacted

**State Responses:**

| State Response | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| **Decoupled from federal schedule** | New York (EO 52.5), California |
| **Followed federal guidance** | Most "red" states |

## Analysis

### What This Means

The U.S. now operates under **two public health regimes**. A citizen's ability to walk into a pharmacy and get a flu shot depends entirely on:

1. Which state they live in
2. Whether their governor has issued emergency orders overriding federal guidance

**The "Passive-Aggressive" Strategy:**

The administration did not ban vaccines. Instead, by changing a classification (Routine → SCDM), they triggered pre-existing state "trigger laws" that restricted access. This allows officials to claim they are preserving "choice" while effectively dismantling mass vaccination infrastructure.

**The SCDM Loophole:**

"Shared Clinical Decision-Making" sounds neutral but creates friction. Instead of receiving vaccines automatically during pediatric visits, parents must now actively request them and have a conversation with their doctor. For working families with limited appointment time, this barrier reduces vaccination rates even when vaccines remain technically available.

### Who Is Affected

- **Rural residents**: Pharmacies are often the only healthcare access point; prescription requirements create barriers
- **Uninsured/underinsured**: May face new copays as "SCDM" status creates insurance coverage grey areas
- **Children**: Reduced vaccination rates increase disease transmission risk in schools
- **Healthcare workers**: Confusion over changing guidelines and scope of practice
- **Elderly**: Flu vaccines are critical; reduced access increases mortality risk

### Legal/Policy Context

**ACA Preventive Care Mandate:**

The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover "recommended" preventive care without cost-sharing. The SCDM reclassification creates ambiguity:
- Are SCDM vaccines still "recommended"?
- Can insurers now charge copays?

This is likely to be litigated.

**State Authority:**

States control pharmacy licensing and scope of practice. The federal government cannot force states to allow pharmacy vaccination, but states can choose to decouple their rules from federal recommendations.
