# Voting Rights Under Attack

## Quick Summary

Since January 2025, a coordinated campaign has targeted the right to vote through mass voter roll purges affecting millions, new proof-of-citizenship requirements that disenfranchise eligible voters, gutting of the DOJ Voting Rights Division, defunding of federal election security infrastructure, and a wave of state-level restrictions disproportionately affecting communities of color, young voters, and elderly Americans. These actions are justified by the debunked myth of widespread noncitizen voting, which studies consistently show occurs at rates near zero.

## Facts

### Key Points

- **Executive Order 14165** (February 2025) directed federal agencies to share citizenship data with states for voter roll purges, raising privacy concerns and creating a chilling effect on eligible voters with immigration connections in their households.

- **The SAVE Act** (Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act) passed the House in 2025 requiring documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections, despite it already being illegal for noncitizens to vote under 18 U.S.C. Section 611.

- **The DOJ Civil Rights Division's Voting Section** experienced mass departures and leadership changes in 2025, with career attorneys reassigned and active voting rights enforcement cases deprioritized or abandoned.

- **CISA's election security division** was restructured and downsized following years of political attacks, reducing federal support for state and local election cybersecurity.

- **The Brennan Center for Justice** documented that between 2021 and 2023, states purged voters from rolls at the highest rate since the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013). The pace has accelerated since 2025.

- **At least 29 states** introduced or passed new voting restriction bills in 2025, including limits on mail voting, reduced early voting hours, new ID requirements, and restrictions on voter registration drives.

- **Federal election security grants** through the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) were frozen or reduced in FY2025-2026, leaving local election offices without resources to upgrade aging voting infrastructure.

- **Multiple federal courts** have struck down voter purge programs in Virginia, Texas, and Alabama for violating the National Voter Registration Act's 90-day quiet period before elections.

### [+] Voter Roll Purges

**The Scale of the Problem:**

Between 2021 and 2022, states removed approximately 19.3 million voters from registration rolls, according to the Election Assistance Commission's biennial survey. While routine list maintenance is legal and necessary (removing deceased voters, those who moved, etc.), the post-2025 purges have been characterized by aggressive programs that sweep up eligible voters.

[source: Brennan Center - Voter Purge Rates Remain High](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voter-purge-rates-remain-high-analysis-2021-2022-data)

**Executive Order 14165 - Federal Data Sharing:**

Signed in February 2025, this executive order directed the Department of Homeland Security, Social Security Administration, and other federal agencies to share immigration and citizenship databases with state election officials. This created a system where:

- States can cross-reference voter rolls against DHS immigration records
- Mismatches (common with naturalized citizens, name changes, or data entry errors) can trigger removal
- No uniform standard exists for how states must handle mismatches
- Voters may be purged without notification or opportunity to correct errors

**State-Level Purge Programs:**

**Texas:** Governor Abbott announced a purge of over 1 million names from voter rolls in 2024, claiming they were noncitizens. Subsequent analysis revealed the vast majority were naturalized citizens or data entry errors. A federal court ordered Texas to restore improperly purged voters under the NVRA.

[source: Texas Secretary of State - Texas Leads the Way Against Noncitizen Voting (August 2024)](https://www.sos.state.tx.us/about/newsreleases/2024/081224-2.shtml)

**Virginia:** In August 2024, Governor Youngkin issued Executive Order 35 directing a purge of alleged noncitizens from voter rolls. The DOJ sued Virginia for violating the NVRA's 90-day quiet period, and a federal court ordered the names restored just before the November 2024 election. The Supreme Court declined to block the restoration order in *Virginia v. United States*.

[source: DOJ Press Release - Justice Department Sues Virginia for Violating NVRA (October 2024)](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-virginia-violating-federal-laws-prohibition-systematic-efforts)

**Alabama:** Secretary of State Wes Allen announced a purge of 3,251 voters identified as noncitizens through a DHS database match. The DOJ sued, and investigation revealed that many flagged voters were naturalized citizens. A federal court ordered restoration.

**Georgia:** The State Election Board adopted new rules in 2024 allowing county boards to conduct "reasonable inquiry" into voter eligibility based on challenges filed by private citizens, enabling mass challenges. Thousands of voter registrations were challenged in Gwinnett, Cobb, and Fulton counties.

[source: Georgia State Election Board Rule 183-1-12-.02 - Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (July 2024)](https://sos.ga.gov/sites/default/files/2024-07/Notice%20of%20Proposed%20Rulemaking%20-%20183-1-12-.02.pdf)

**The Pattern:** Purge programs disproportionately affect:
- Naturalized citizens (name changes, data format mismatches)
- Voters of color (higher rates of residential mobility)
- Young voters (more frequent address changes)
- Voters in urban areas (more frequent moves)

---

### [+] New Voting Restrictions

**The SAVE Act (H.R. 22 / S. 23):**

The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, passed by the House in July 2025, requires documentary proof of U.S. citizenship (birth certificate, passport, or naturalization certificate) to register to vote in federal elections.

**Key provisions:**
- Requires one of: U.S. passport, birth certificate, or naturalization certificate at time of registration
- States must audit existing voter rolls against citizenship databases
- Penalties for election officials who register voters without proof of citizenship
- Applies to all federal elections

**Why this matters:**
- An estimated 21 million voting-age U.S. citizens lack readily accessible documentary proof of citizenship, according to the Brennan Center for Justice
- These citizens are disproportionately elderly (born before universal birth certificate registration), low-income, and people of color
- Obtaining replacement documents costs money and time (birth certificate copies: $10-30; passport: $130+)
- Creates a modern-day poll tax effect

[source: Brennan Center - Citizens Without Proof](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-without-proof)

**State-Level Restriction Wave (2025-2026):**

**Mail Voting Restrictions:**
- **Ohio (SB 1, 2025):** Reduced the mail ballot request period from 45 days to 21 days before an election and eliminated no-excuse absentee voting
- **Georgia (SB 189, 2025):** Required a photocopy of photo ID with every mail ballot application, replacing the signature match system
- **Texas (SB 1750, 2025):** Imposed new criminal penalties on election workers who proactively send mail ballot applications

**Early Voting Cutbacks:**
- Multiple states reduced early voting periods, particularly on Sundays (targeting "Souls to the Polls" programs used by Black churches)
- **Georgia:** Prohibited counties from offering more than one Sunday of early voting
- **North Carolina:** Reduced the early voting period from 17 days to 10 days for municipal elections

**Voter Registration Restrictions:**
- **Florida (SB 7050, 2023, expanded 2025):** Imposed felony penalties on third-party voter registration organizations that fail to meet strict submission deadlines, causing the League of Women Voters to pause registration drives in Florida for the first time in over 100 years
- **Kansas:** Required proof of citizenship for new voter registrations, a law previously struck down by federal courts in *Fish v. Kobach* but reintroduced in 2025
- **Arizona:** Dual-track registration system requiring proof of citizenship for full ballot access (state + federal races) versus federal-form-only registration (federal races only)

[source: Brennan Center - State Voting Laws Roundup: October 2025](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/state-voting-laws-roundup-october-2025)

**Voter ID Laws Tightened:**
- **North Carolina:** Strict photo ID law implemented after Supreme Court allowed it to take effect
- **Arkansas:** Eliminated the option to sign an affidavit in lieu of showing photo ID
- **Montana:** Eliminated student ID cards as valid voter identification

### [+] Federal Election Security Defunded

**CISA Election Security Division Restructured:**

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which under the Biden administration served as the federal government's lead agency for election security, has been significantly restructured:

- CISA Director Jen Easterly departed in January 2025
- The Mis-, Dis-, and Malinformation (MDM) team was disbanded
- The election security advisory committee was dissolved
- Staffing for election security services reduced

CISA had previously provided free cybersecurity assessments, vulnerability scanning, and incident response support to all 50 states. The reduction in services leaves thousands of local election offices more vulnerable to cyberattacks.

[source: Votebeat - CISA Halts Support for States on Election Security (March 2025)](https://www.votebeat.org/2025/03/11/cisa-ends-support-election-security-nass-nased/)

**Election Assistance Commission (EAC) Budget Cuts:**

The EAC, the only federal agency exclusively dedicated to election administration, faced proposed budget cuts in FY2025 and FY2026:

- FY2025 budget proposal: Reduced funding for Help America Vote Act (HAVA) grants
- Election Security Grants (authorized by HAVA Section 101): Frozen at 2024 levels despite rising cybersecurity costs
- Testing and certification of voting systems: Underfunded, creating backlogs in certifying new voting equipment
- The EAC commissioners faced vacancies, leaving the commission without a quorum for periods in 2025

[source: Election Assistance Commission - Election Security Grants](https://www.eac.gov/grants/election-security-funds)

**Impact on Local Election Offices:**

According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, local election offices face:
- Aging voting equipment averaging 10+ years old in many jurisdictions
- Rising cybersecurity threats without federal support
- Loss of trained cybersecurity personnel
- Inability to afford independent security audits
- Increasing physical threats to election workers (over 2,000 incidents reported to the DOJ between 2020-2024)

### [+] DOJ Voting Rights Division Gutted

**Background:**

The DOJ Civil Rights Division's Voting Section is the primary federal entity responsible for enforcing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the National Voter Registration Act, the Help America Vote Act, and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act.

**Changes Since January 2025:**

- **Leadership:** Political appointees replaced career leadership in the Voting Section
- **Staffing:** Career voting rights attorneys reassigned to other divisions or left the department; the section experienced its largest staff reduction since the 1960s
- **Active Cases:** Multiple pending voting rights enforcement actions were deprioritized, settled on unfavorable terms, or dropped
- **Section 2 Enforcement:** The DOJ reversed its position in active Section 2 (vote dilution) cases, in some instances switching sides to support states that had been sued

**Specific Case Changes:**

- **Allen v. Milligan (Alabama redistricting follow-up):** The DOJ reduced its enforcement posture on the court-ordered remedial maps
- **Virginia voter purge case:** After suing Virginia in 2024, the DOJ's posture shifted in 2025; the new administration did not pursue further enforcement
- **Texas redistricting:** The DOJ withdrew from its role monitoring Texas redistricting under consent decrees dating back decades

**Historical Context:**

The Voting Section was created by the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and strengthened by the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It brought cases that dismantled Jim Crow-era voter suppression. The gutting of this division represents the most significant rollback of federal voting rights enforcement capacity since Reconstruction.

[source: DOJ Civil Rights Division - Voting Section](https://www.justice.gov/crt/voting-section)

**Shelby County v. Holder Legacy:**

In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down the preclearance formula in Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act in *Shelby County v. Holder*, 570 U.S. 529 (2013). This eliminated the requirement that states with histories of discrimination obtain federal approval before changing voting laws. Since that decision:

- States previously covered by preclearance have enacted voting restrictions at nearly twice the rate of other states
- The Brennan Center documented that formerly covered jurisdictions closed over 1,688 polling places between 2012 and 2018
- Congress has not passed replacement legislation (the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act has stalled repeatedly)

### [+] The "Noncitizen Voting" Myth

**The Claim:**

The primary justification for proof-of-citizenship requirements, voter roll purges, and new restrictions is the assertion that large numbers of noncitizens are voting in U.S. elections. This claim has been central to political messaging since 2016.

**The Evidence:**

Every comprehensive study of noncitizen voting has found it occurs at rates near zero:

- **Brennan Center (2017):** Surveyed 42 jurisdictions responsible for 23.5 million votes in the 2016 election. Found approximately 30 incidents of suspected noncitizen voting out of 23.5 million votes (0.0001%).

[source: Brennan Center - Debunking the Voter Fraud Myth](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/debunking-voter-fraud-myth)

- **Heritage Foundation Election Fraud Database:** The Heritage Foundation, a conservative organization supportive of voter ID laws, maintains a database of proven election fraud cases. As of 2024, it documents approximately 1,500 cases of proven fraud of all types across the entire United States over more than 40 years. Noncitizen voting cases represent a tiny fraction.

[source: Heritage Foundation - Election Fraud Cases](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud)

- **Cato Institute (2020):** Found that "the rate of noncitizen voting in American elections is close to zero" and that existing penalties (felony conviction, deportation) serve as effective deterrents.

- **Government Accountability Office (2005):** Found no evidence of widespread noncitizen voter registration.

- **Kansas Proof of Citizenship Experiment:** When Kansas implemented proof-of-citizenship requirements under Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the state identified only 67 noncitizens who had attempted to register out of 1.7 million registered voters over several years. Of those, most had self-corrected. The program was struck down in *Fish v. Kobach* (2018) by a federal court that found the requirement blocked an estimated 31,000 eligible citizens from registering while catching virtually no noncitizens.

[source: Fish v. Kobach, 309 F. Supp. 3d 1048 (D. Kan. 2018)](https://casetext.com/case/fish-v-kobach-5)

**Why the Myth Persists:**

- It justifies restrictions that disproportionately affect demographics that vote for particular parties
- It creates a narrative of election illegitimacy that undermines trust in democratic outcomes
- Database matching programs produce high false positive rates, generating large numbers that sound alarming but dissolve upon investigation

**It Is Already Illegal:**

Noncitizen voting in federal elections is a federal crime under 18 U.S.C. Section 611, punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine. For noncitizens seeking legal status, it also triggers deportation and permanent inadmissibility. The existing penalties make it one of the highest-risk, lowest-reward crimes possible.

[source: 18 U.S.C. Section 611 - Voting by Aliens](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title18-section611&num=0&edition=prelim)

### [+] Gerrymandering and Redistricting

**Current Status:**

Following the 2020 Census, states redrew congressional and legislative districts. Several key developments have shaped the redistricting landscape:

- **Rucho v. Common Cause (2019):** The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that federal courts cannot hear challenges to partisan gerrymandering, calling it a "political question." This closed the federal courthouse door to gerrymandering claims.

[source: Rucho v. Common Cause, 588 U.S. 684 (2019)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/588/684/)

- **Allen v. Milligan (2023):** The Supreme Court upheld a challenge to Alabama's congressional map under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, ruling that the state had diluted Black voting power. Alabama was ordered to draw a second majority-Black congressional district.

[source: Allen v. Milligan, 599 U.S. 1 (2023)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/599/1/)

- **Alexander v. South Carolina NAACP (2024):** The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in favor of South Carolina, making it harder to prove racial gerrymandering by giving legislatures a presumption of good faith.

**Key States:**

- **North Carolina:** After the state Supreme Court flipped to Republican control in 2022, it reversed its own prior ruling banning partisan gerrymandering, allowing the legislature to draw aggressively partisan maps
- **Ohio:** Despite voters approving anti-gerrymandering constitutional amendments in 2015 and 2018, the legislature repeatedly drew maps rejected by the state Supreme Court; eventually, time constraints forced the use of disputed maps
- **Louisiana:** Following *Allen v. Milligan*, courts ordered Louisiana to draw a second majority-Black congressional district; the legislature complied for 2024 but has signaled intent to revisit
- **Alabama:** Despite the *Milligan* ruling, the legislature initially passed a map that was rejected by a federal court; it eventually complied with a second majority-Black district

---

### [+] Election Administration Changes

**Poll Worker Intimidation and Shortages:**

The 2020 election and its aftermath created a hostile environment for election workers:

- Over 2,000 threats against election workers were reported to the DOJ Election Threats Task Force between 2020 and 2024
- The Brennan Center found that 1 in 3 election workers have experienced threats or harassment
- Many experienced election officials have resigned, creating knowledge gaps
- Recruitment of poll workers has become significantly harder in many jurisdictions

[source: Brennan Center - Local Election Officials Survey (May 2024)](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-may-2024)

**Ballot Counting Rule Changes:**

Several states changed rules governing how ballots are counted:

- **Georgia (SB 202 and subsequent Election Board rules):** Required hand counts of ballots at polling places, later blocked by a court; gave the State Election Board power to investigate county election boards and potentially delay certification
- **Arizona:** New laws requiring hand counts of early ballots in addition to machine tabulation
- **Nevada:** Mandatory hand count legislation proposed (later blocked by courts)

**Election Certification:**

After the 2020 election, several county boards initially refused to certify results. New laws and rules in multiple states have addressed certification:

- **Arizona:** Made it a misdemeanor for county supervisors to refuse to canvass election results
- **Georgia:** The State Election Board initially adopted a rule allowing county boards to conduct "reasonable inquiry" before certifying results, potentially enabling certification delays; a court struck down this rule before the 2024 election
- **New Mexico:** A county commissioner who refused to certify the 2022 primary was removed from office

**Partisan Election Review Efforts:**

Following the 2020 election, several states conducted partisan "election reviews" that undermined public confidence:

- The Maricopa County, Arizona "audit" by Cyber Ninjas (2021) ultimately confirmed Biden's victory while costing taxpayers millions and introducing conspiracy theories into the public discourse
- Similar review efforts were launched in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan
- These reviews established a pattern of questioning legitimate election results

---

### [+] State-Level Voting Restriction Wave

Since the 2020 election, the pace of new voting restrictions has accelerated dramatically:

**By the Numbers (2021-2025):**
- At least 94 restrictive voting laws enacted in 29 states between 2021 and 2024
- 2025 legislative sessions introduced over 400 bills that would restrict voting access
- In the same period, some states expanded voting access (e.g., Minnesota, Michigan, Nevada)

[source: Brennan Center - State Voting Laws Roundup: October 2025](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/state-voting-laws-roundup-october-2025)

**Categories of Restrictions:**

**1. Mail/Absentee Voting:**
- Stricter ID requirements for requesting and returning mail ballots
- Reduced timeframes for requesting mail ballots
- Bans on ballot drop boxes or severe limitations on their availability
- Bans on prepaid postage for mail ballots
- Prohibitions on third-party collection of completed ballots

**2. In-Person Voting:**
- Reduced early voting hours and days
- Closure of polling places (disproportionately in communities of color)
- Stricter voter ID requirements
- Bans on mobile voting centers
- Restrictions on "Souls to the Polls" Sunday voting

**3. Voter Registration:**
- Proof-of-citizenship requirements
- Restrictions on same-day registration
- Limits on third-party registration drives
- Automatic voter roll purge triggers
- Reduced registration deadlines

**4. Criminalization:**
- New felony penalties for election workers who make errors
- Criminal penalties for providing food or water to voters in line (Georgia SB 202)
- Penalties for voter registration organizations that miss deadlines
- Expanded criminal penalties for "voter fraud" with vague definitions

## Analysis

Since the *Shelby County v. Holder* decision in 2013, the infrastructure that protected voting rights for half a century has been systematically dismantled. What began as a Supreme Court ruling removing federal preclearance has expanded into a multi-front campaign affecting every stage of the voting process: registration, casting a ballot, and having that ballot counted.

### [+] What This Means

**The End of Federal Voting Rights Enforcement:**

For the first time since the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, the federal government has effectively abandoned its role as the primary enforcer of voting rights. The DOJ Voting Section -- historically the most powerful tool against voter suppression -- has been repurposed. This means:

- States with histories of discrimination face no federal check on new restrictions
- Legal challenges must now be brought entirely by private organizations (ACLU, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Brennan Center), which have limited resources
- The deterrent effect of potential federal enforcement has evaporated
- The pattern mirrors the end of Reconstruction, when the federal government withdrew from enforcing civil rights in the South

**A Return to State-by-State Voting Rights:**

Without effective federal enforcement, voting rights now depend entirely on which state you live in:
- States like California, Minnesota, and Michigan have expanded access (automatic registration, same-day registration, no-excuse mail voting)
- States like Georgia, Texas, and Florida have enacted waves of restrictions
- This creates a two-tier system where the ease of voting depends on geography, not citizenship

**Election Security Degraded:**

The defunding of CISA election security services and EAC grants comes at a time of increasing cyber threats:
- Russian, Chinese, and Iranian state actors have all been documented attempting to interfere in U.S. elections
- Local election offices are the most vulnerable point in the system
- Without federal support, small counties cannot afford cybersecurity assessments
- The irony: an administration claiming to protect "election integrity" has defunded the actual infrastructure that secures elections

### [+] Who Is Affected

**Communities of Color:**

Voting restrictions disproportionately affect Black, Latino, and Native American voters. This is not incidental -- it is the documented effect of specific policy choices:

- **Polling place closures** have been concentrated in communities of color, particularly in states formerly covered by VRA preclearance
- **Voter ID laws** disproportionately affect Black and Latino voters, who are less likely to have government-issued photo ID (studies show 25% of Black voting-age citizens lack photo ID compared to 8% of white citizens)
- **Purge programs** using database matching disproportionately flag voters with names common in non-English-speaking communities
- **Restrictions on Sunday voting** specifically target "Souls to the Polls" programs that are a tradition in Black churches

**Young Voters (18-29):**

- More frequent address changes trigger purge programs
- Student ID restrictions (Montana, others) create barriers at college campuses
- Restrictions on same-day registration disproportionately affect first-time voters
- Reduced early voting hours conflict with work and school schedules

**Elderly Voters:**

- Born before universal birth certificate registration, making proof-of-citizenship requirements especially burdensome
- More likely to vote by mail; restrictions on mail voting create barriers
- Less likely to have current photo ID if no longer driving
- Mobility limitations make polling place closures particularly impactful

**Rural Voters:**

- Polling place closures increase travel distances
- Limited public transportation options
- Fewer early voting locations
- Less internet access for online registration

**Voters with Disabilities:**

- Polling place closures and moves create accessibility challenges
- Some new voting procedures lack accessibility accommodations
- Restrictions on absentee voting affect those who cannot easily travel to polls

**Native American Voters:**

- Lack of traditional street addresses on reservations creates problems with ID and registration requirements
- Remote reservation locations mean long travel distances to polls
- Language assistance requirements are inconsistently enforced
- *Brnovich v. DNC* (2021) weakened protections against laws that disproportionately burden tribal voters

### [+] The Strategy Behind Voter Suppression

**The Pattern:**

Voter suppression in its modern form follows a consistent, identifiable strategy:

**1. Manufacture a Crisis:** Promote the narrative that noncitizen voting or election fraud is widespread, despite all evidence showing it is vanishingly rare. Use large numbers from database mismatches (which dissolve upon investigation) to create urgency.

**2. Pass Restrictions Justified by the "Crisis":** Enact proof-of-citizenship requirements, aggressive purge programs, voter ID laws, and other restrictions, all framed as protecting "election integrity." The restrictions happen to disproportionately affect demographic groups that vote for the opposing party.

**3. Defund Oversight:** Gut the federal agencies (DOJ Voting Section, CISA, EAC) that would enforce voting rights and detect actual election security problems. This removes the entities most likely to challenge the restrictions.

**4. Close the Courthouse Door:** Through judicial appointments and favorable rulings (*Shelby County*, *Rucho*, *Brnovich*, *Alexander v. SC NAACP*), make it harder to challenge restrictions in court. The cumulative effect of these decisions has raised the burden of proof for voting rights plaintiffs while lowering the burden on states to justify restrictions.

**5. Control Election Administration:** Through state election board appointments, secretary of state races, and county-level election official replacements, install allies who will enforce restrictions aggressively and potentially resist certifying unfavorable results.

**Historical Parallel:**

This strategy mirrors the post-Reconstruction era (1877-1965), when Southern states systematically disenfranchised Black voters through:
- Poll taxes (modern equivalent: proof-of-citizenship document costs)
- Literacy tests (modern equivalent: complex registration requirements)
- Grandfather clauses (modern equivalent: protections for existing voters but barriers for new registrants)
- White primaries (modern equivalent: gerrymandering that dilutes minority voting power)

The methods have evolved but the structure remains: use facially neutral requirements that disproportionately burden specific communities, backed by a narrative that frames suppression as protection.
