Subject: Protect Due Process for All

Dear [Representative],

I am writing as your constituent to express deep concern about
immigration enforcement actions that bypass established legal
procedures. The Constitution guarantees due process to all persons
within U.S. borders, not just citizens.

I urge you to:
- Oppose funding for enforcement that circumvents immigration courts
- Support legislation requiring judicial review before deportation
- Conduct oversight of ICE and CBP enforcement practices

The rule of law must apply equally. Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
