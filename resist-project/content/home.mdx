## Guiding Principles

1. **Primary sources or nothing** — Federal Register, Congress.gov, court filings, .gov domains
2. **Facts and analysis separated** — Readers always know what's verified vs. interpreted
3. **Action over awareness** — Information without action is insufficient
4. **Credibility is paramount** — One bad source undermines everything
5. **Non-partisan framing** — Focus on rights and principles, not party politics
